  abstract={Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered the precursor of Alzheimer’s disease. However, MCI is associated with substantially variable progression rates, which are not well understood. Attempts to identify the mechanisms that underlie MCI progression have often focused on the hippocampus but have mostly overlooked its intricate structure and subdivisions. Here, we utilized deep learning to delineate the contribution of hippocampal subfields to MCI progression. We propose a dense convolutional neural network architecture that differentiates stable and progressive MCI based on hippocampal morphometry with an accuracy of 75.85\%. A novel implementation of occlusion analysis revealed marked differences in the contribution of hippocampal subfields to the performance of the model, with presubiculum, CA1, subiculum, and molecular layer showing the most central role. Moreover, the analysis reveals that 10.5\% of the volume of the hippocampus was redundant in the differentiation between stable and progressive MCI.},

  abstract={Perfusion imaging is of great clinical importance and is used to assess a wide range of diseases including strokes and brain tumors. Commonly used approaches for the quantitative analysis of perfusion images are based on measuring the effect of a contrast agent moving through blood vessels and into tissue. Contrast-agent free approaches, for example, based on intravoxel incoherent motion and arterial spin labeling, also exist, but are so far not routinely used clinically. Existing contrast-agent-dependent methods typically rely on the estimation of the arterial input function (AIF) to approximately model tissue perfusion. These approaches neglect spatial dependencies. Further, as reliably estimating the AIF is non-trivial, different AIF estimates may lead to different perfusion measures. In this work we therefore propose PIANO, an approach that provides additional insights into the perfusion process. PIANO estimates the velocity and diffusion fields of an advection-diffusion model best explaining the contrast dynamics without using an AIF. PIANO accounts for spatial dependencies and neither requires estimating the AIF nor relies on a particular contrast agent bolus shape. Specifically, we propose a convenient parameterization of the estimation problem, a numerical estimation approach, and extensively evaluate PIANO. Simulation experiments show the robustness and effectiveness of PIANO, along with its ability to distinguish between advection and diffusion. We further apply PIANO on a public brain magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion dataset of acute stroke patients, and demonstrate that PIANO can successfully resolve velocity and diffusion field ambiguities and results in sensitive measures for the assessment of stroke, comparing favorably to conventional measures of perfusion.},

  abstract={Cerebral vasospasm is a dreaded sequelae of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), requiring timely intervention with therapeutic goals of improving brain perfusion. There are currently no standardized real-time, objective assessments of the interventional procedures performed to treat vasospasm. Here we describe real-time techniques to quantify cerebral perfusion during interventional cerebral angiography. We retrospectively analyzed 39 consecutive cases performed to treat clinical vasospasm and quantified the changes in perfusion metrics between pre- and post- verapamil administrations. With Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) perfusion analysis, we are able to identify hypoperfused territories and quantify the exact changes in cerebral perfusion for each individual case and vascular territory. We demonstrate that perfusion analysis for DSA can be performed in real time. This provides clinicians with a colorized map which directly visualizes hypoperfused tissue, combined with associated perfusion statistics. Quantitative thresholds and analysis based on DSA perfusion may assist with real-time dosage estimation and help predict response to treatment, however future prospective analysis is required for validation.},

  abstract={Purpose: Accurate deformable registration between computed tomography (CT) and cone-beam CT (CBCT) images of pancreatic cancer patients treated with high biologically effective radiation doses is essential to assess changes in organ-at-risk (OAR) locations and shapes and to compute delivered dose. This study describes the development and evaluation of a deep-learning (DL) registration model to predict OAR segmentations on the CBCT derived from segmentations on the planning CT. Methods: The DL model is trained with CT-CBCT image pairs of the same patient, on which OAR segmentations of the small bowel, stomach, and duodenum have been manually drawn. A transformation map is obtained, which serves to warp the CT image and segmentations. In addition to a regularity loss and an image similarity loss, an OAR segmentation similarity loss is also used during training, which penalizes the mismatch between warped CT segmentations and manually drawn CBCT segmentations. At test time, CBCT segmentations are not required as they are instead obtained from the warped CT segmentations. In an IRB-approved retrospective study, a dataset consisting of 40 patients, each with one planning CT and two CBCT scans, was used in a fivefold cross-validation to train and evaluate the model, using physician-drawn segmentations as reference. Images were preprocessed to remove gas pockets. Network performance was compared to two intensity-based deformable registration algorithms (large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping [LDDMM] and multimodality free-form [MMFF]) as baseline. Evaluated metrics were Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), change in OAR volume within a volume of interest (enclosing the low-dose PTV plus 1 cm margin) from planning CT to CBCT, and maximum dose to 5 cm3 of the OAR [D(5cc)]. Results: Processing time for one CT-CBCT registration with the DL model at test time was less than 5 seconds on a GPU-based system, compared to an average of 30 minutes for LDDMM optimization. For both small bowel and stomach/duodenum, the DL model yielded larger median DSC and smaller interquartile variation than either MMFF (paired t-test P < 10−4 for both type of OARs) or LDDMM (P < 10−3 and P = 0.03 respectively). Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of DL-predicted change in small bowel volume relative to reference was 22\% less than for MMFF (P = 0.007). RMSD of DL-predicted stomach/duodenum volume change was 28\% less than for LDDMM (P = 0.0001). RMSD of DL-predicted D(5cc) in small bowel was 39\% less than for MMFF (P = 0.001); in stomach/duodenum, RMSD of DL-predicted D(5cc) was 18\% less than for LDDMM (P < 10−3). Conclusions: The proposed deep network CT-to-CBCT deformable registration model shows improved segmentation accuracy compared to intensity-based algorithms and achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction in processing time.},

In this analysis, the cumulative effects of exposure to ketamine, Telazol® (tiletamine and zolazepam), and the inhaled anaesthetic isoflurane on early brain development were evaluated in two independent cohorts of typically developing rhesus macaques. Methods: Diffusion MRI scans were analysed from 43 rhesus macaques (20 females and 23 males) at either 12 or 18 months of age from two separate primate colonies. Results: Significant, widespread reductions in fractional anisotropy with corresponding increased axial, mean, and radial diffusivity were observed across the brain as a result of repeated anaesthesia exposures. These effects were dose dependent and remained after accounting for age and sex at time of exposure in a generalised linear model. Decreases of up to 40\% in fractional anisotropy were detected in some brain regions. Conclusions: Multiple exposures to commonly used anaesthetics were associated with marked changes in white matter microstructure. This study is amongst the first to examine clinically relevant anaesthesia exposures on the developing primate brain. It will be important to examine if, or to what degree, the maturing brain can recover from these white matter changes.},

 abstract = {Transport processes are ubiquitous. They are, for example, at the heart of optical flow approaches; or of perfusion imaging, where blood transport is assessed, most commonly by injecting a tracer. An advection-diffusion equation is widely used to describe these transport phenomena. Our goal is estimating the underlying physics of advection-diffusion equations, expressed as velocity and diffusion tensor fields. We propose a learning framework (YETI) building on an auto-encoder structure between 2D and 3D image time-series, which incorporates the advection-diffusion model. To help with identifiability, we develop an advection-diffusion simulator which allows pre-training of our model by supervised learning using the velocity and diffusion tensor fields. Instead of directly learning these velocity and diffusion tensor fields, we introduce representations that assure incompressible flow and symmetric positive semi-definite diffusion fields and demonstrate the additional benefits of these representations on improving estimation accuracy. We further use transfer learning to apply YETI on a public brain magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion dataset of stroke patients and show its ability to successfully distinguish stroke lesions from normal brain regions via the estimated velocity and diffusion tensor fields.},

  abstract={RNA-based, multi-gene molecular assays are available and widely used for patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancers. However, RNA-based genomic tests can be costly and are not available in many countries. Methods for inferring molecular subtype from histologic images may identify patients most likely to benefit from further genomic testing. To identify patients who could benefit from molecular testing based on H&E stained histologic images, we developed an image analysis approach using deep learning. A training set of 571 breast tumors was used to create image-based classifiers for tumor grade, ER status, PAM50 intrinsic subtype, histologic subtype, and risk of recurrence score (ROR-PT). The resulting classifiers were applied to an independent test set (n = 288), and accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of each was assessed on the test set. Histologic image analysis with deep learning distinguished low-intermediate vs. high tumor grade (82\% accuracy), ER status (84\% accuracy), Basal-like vs. non-Basal-like (77\% accuracy), Ductal vs. Lobular (94\% accuracy), and high vs. low-medium ROR-PT score (75\% accuracy). Sampling considerations in the training set minimized bias in the test set. Incorrect classification of ER status was significantly more common for Luminal B tumors. These data provide proof of principle that molecular marker status, including a critical clinical biomarker (i.e., ER status), can be predicted with accuracy >75\% based on H&E features. Image-based methods could be promising for identifying patients with a greater need for further genomic testing, or in place of classically scored variables typically accomplished using human-based scoring.},

  abstract={We present a common framework, for registering images to an atlas and for forming an unbiased atlas, that tolerates the presence of pathologies such as tumors and traumatic brain injury lesions. This common framework is particularly useful when a sufficient number of protocol-matched scans from healthy subjects cannot be easily acquired for atlas formation and when the pathologies in a patient cause large appearance changes. Our framework combines a low-rank-plus-sparse image decomposition technique with an iterative, diffeomorphic, group-wise image registration method. At each iteration of image registration, the decomposition technique estimates a “healthy” version of each image as its low-rank component and estimates the pathologies in each image as its sparse component. The healthy version of each image is used for the next iteration of image registration. The low-rank and sparse estimates are refined as the image registrations iteratively improve. For unbiased atlas formation, at each iteration, the average of the low-rank images from the patients is used as the atlas image for the next iteration, until convergence. Since each iteration's atlas is comprised of low-rank components, it provides a population-consistent, pathology-free appearance. Evaluations of the proposed methodology are presented using synthetic data as well as simulated and clinical tumor MRI images from the brain tumor segmentation (BRATS) challenge from MICCAI 2012.},

Polysomnograms (n=15) were also analyzed. CT\&rsquo;s were also analyzed by age/weight flow normalization and comparison to an Atlas created from normal CT\&rsquo;s. Five geometric, seven CFD, and five PSG measures were analyzed to determine their correlation with which patients received surgery subsequent to the CT/PSG dataset versus those who did not. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sample t-test with Bonferroni correction and area under the curve analysis. RESULTS: Two geometric indices and one CFD measure were significant for determining which children with SGS received surgery. Polysomnography was less helpful in this determination. Optimal cutoffs for these values were determined from this dataset. CONCLUSIONS: A number of geometric and CFD variables were sensitive at determining which patients with SGS received surgical intervention versus those who did not. Polysomnography was less helpful in making this determination. Discrete, quantitative assessment of the pediatric airway was performed, yielding preliminary data regarding possible objective thresholds for surgical versus non-surgical treatment of disease.

This pairwise registration though results in a well-known template selection bias, which we aim to overcome here via a group-wise approach. We propose the use of an unbiased ensemble entropy minimization following the use of the pairwise registration as an initialization. An individual deformation field is then iteratively updated onto the unbiased average. For the optimization, we use metrics specific for cortical correspondence though all of these are straightforwardly extendable to the generic setting: The first focused on optimizing the correspondence of automatically extracted sulcal landmarks and the second on that of sulcal depth property maps. We further propose a robust entropy metric and a hierarchical optimization by employing spherical harmonic basis orthogonality. We also provide the detailed methodological description of both our earlier work and the proposed method with a set of experiments on a population of human and non-human primate subjects.

	abstract = {<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis; it is characterized by the loss of cartilage. Automatic quantitative methods are needed to screen large image databases to assess changes in cartilage morphology. This dissertation presents an automatic analysis method to quantitatively analyze longitudinal cartilage changes from knee magnetic resonance (MR) images. A novel robust automatic cartilage segmentation method is proposed to overcome the limitations of existing cartilage segmentation methods. The dissertation presents a new and general convex three-label segmentation approach to ensure the separation of touching objects, i.e., femoral and tibial cartilage. Anisotropic spatial regularization is introduced to avoid over-regularization by isotropic regularization on thin objects. Temporal regularization is further incorporated to encourage temporally-consistent segmentations across time points for longitudinal data. The state-of-the-art analysis of cartilage changes relies on the subdivision of cartilage, which is coarse and purely geometric whereas cartilage loss is a local thinning process and exhibits spatial nonuniformity. A statistical analysis method is proposed to study localized longitudinal cartilage thickness changes by establishing spatial correspondences across time and between subjects. The method is general and can be applied to nonuniform morphological changes in other diseases.</p>

A common purpose to study evolutions is to assess local tissue growth or decay as observed in the context of neurodevelopment or neurodegeneration. Hence, preserving this information under transport is important to allow for faithful statistical analysis in the common coordinate system. Most basically, we require scale invariance. Here, we show that a scale invariant metric does not exist in the LDDMM setting. We illustrate the impact of this non-invariance on parallel transport. We also propose a new class of Riemannian metrics on shapes which preserves the variation of a global indicator such as volume under parallel transport.},

Analysis revealed features related to nuclear size, shape, and distance between nuclei most important. Dividing melanoma into subtypes, even greater separation was obtained (ROC area 0.98 for superficial spreading melanoma; 0.95 for lentigo maligna melanoma; and 0.99 for unclassified). Severely dysplastic nevi were best differentiated from conventional and mildly dysplastic nevi by differences in cellular staining qualities (ROC area 0.84). We found that melanoma were separated from severely dysplastic nevi by features related to cell shape and cellular staining qualities (ROC area 0.95).

ChAc presents with progressive limb and orobuccal chorea, but there is often a marked dysexecutive syndrome. ChAc may first present with neuropsychiatric disturbance such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suggesting a particular role for disruption to striatal structures involved in non-motor frontostriatal loops, such as the head of the caudate nucleus. Two previous studies have suggested a marked reduction in volume in the caudate nucleus and putamen, but did not examine morphometric change. We investigated morphometric change in 13 patients with genetically or biochemically confirmed ChAc and 26 age- and gender-matched controls. Subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging and manual segmentation of the caudate nucleus and putamen, and shape analysis using a non-parametric spherical harmonic technique. Both structures showed significant and marked reductions in volume compared with controls, with reduction greatest in the caudate nucleus. Both structures showed significant shape differences, particularly in the head of the caudate nucleus. No significant correlation was shown between duration of illness and striatal volume or shape, suggesting that much structural change may have already taken place at the time of symptom onset. Our results suggest that striatal neuron loss may occur early in the disease process, and follows a dorsal-ventral gradient that may correlate with early neuropsychiatric and cognitive presentations of the disease.},

	abstract = {Respiratory motion challenges lung radiation therapy with uncertainties of the location of important anatomical structures in the thorax. To capture the trajectory of the motion, dense image matching methods and learning-based motion prediction methods have been commonly used. However, both methods have limitations. Serious motion artifacts in treatment-guidance images, such as streak artifacts in respiration-correlated cone-beam CT, challenge the intensity-based image matching; the learning-based prediction methods require consistency between the training data for planning and the data for treatment. This paper proposes a prediction-driven motion atlas framework for motion estimation with artifact-laden images, using a Frechet-mean-image matching scheme that is softly constrained by deformation predictions. In this framework, all the respiration phase-stamped images within a breathing cycle are diffeomorphically deformed to their Frechet mean. The iterative optimization is driven by both intensity matching forces and the prediction forces trained from patient-specific planning images. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated with computational phantom and real cone-beam CT images.},

Diagnoses were based on international consensus criteria. Manual bilateral segmentation of the caudate nucleus and putamen was conducted blind to diagnosis by a single analyst, on MRI scans using a standardized protocol. Intra-cranial volume was calculated via a stereological point counting technique and was used for normalizing the shape analysis. Segmented binaries were analyzed using the SPHARM Shape Analysis tools (University of North Carolina) to perform comparisons between FTLD subtypes and controls for global shape difference, local significance maps and mean magnitude maps of shape displacement. Shape analysis revealed that there was significant shape difference between FTLD subtypes and controls, consistent with the predicted frontostriatal dysfunction and of significant magnitude, as measured by displacement maps. These differences were not significant for SD compared to controls; lesser for PNFA compared to controls; whilst FTD showed a more specific pattern in regions relaying fronto- and cortico-striatal circuits. Shape analysis shows regional specificity of atrophy, manifest as shape deflation, with a differential between FTLD subtypes, compared to controls.},

Changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) were measured with the fluorescent dye fura-2/AM. We combined migratory parameters in a mathematical model and described it as mobility;. After adding calcium, a dose-dependant increase in cell speed was found. Cyclic AMP increased mobility as well as the [Ca(2+)](i). In contrast, adding dbcGMP resulted in a significant decrease in the mobility of the ESCs. During migration ESCs showed an increase in [Ca(2+)](i). Furthermore, TNF-alpha dramatically increased the movement as well as the directionality of ESCs. These results demonstrate that ESCs are highly motile and respond to different concentrations of calcium in a dose-related manner.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previously, we reported abnormal volume and global shape in the caudate nucleus in schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). Here, we use a new shape measure which importantly permits local in addition to global shape analysis, as well as local correlations with behavioral measures. METHODS: Thirty-two female and 15 male SPDs, and 29 female and 14 male normal controls (NCLs), underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We assessed caudate shape measures using spherical harmonic-point distribution model (SPHARM-PDM) methodology. RESULTS: We found more pronounced global shape differences in the right caudate in male and female SPD, compared with NCLs. Local shape differences, principally in the caudate head, survived statistical correction on the right. Also, we performed correlations between local surface deformations with clinical measures and found significant correlations between local shape deflated deformations in the anterior medial surface of the caudate with verbal learning capacity in female SPD. CONCLUSIONS: Using SPHARM-PDM methodology, we found both global and local caudate shape abnormalities in male and female SPD, particularly right-sided, and largely restricted to limbic and cognitive anterior caudate. The most important and novel findings were bilateral statistically significant correlations between local surface deflations in the anterior medial surface of the head of the caudate and verbal learning capacity in female SPD. By extension, these local caudate correlation findings implicate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which innervates that area of the caudate, and demonstrate the utility of local shape analysis to investigate the relationship between specific subcortical and cortical brain structures in neuropsychiatric conditions.},

	abstract = {This work provides a framework for modeling and extracting the Cingulum Bundle (CB) from Diffusion-Weighted Imagery (DW-MRI) of the brain. The CB is a tube-like structure in the brain that is of potentially of tremendous importance to clinicians since it may be helpful in diagnosing Schizophrenia. This structure consists of a collection of fibers in the brain that have locally similar diffusion patterns, but vary globally. Standard region-based segmentation techniques adapted to DW-MRI are not suitable here because the diffusion pattern of the CB cannot be described by a global set of simple statistics. Active surface models extended to DW-MRI are not suitable since they allow for arbitrary deformations that give rise to unlikely shapes, which do not respect the tubular geometry of the CB. In this work, we explicitly model the CB as a tube-like surface and construct a general class of energies defined on tube-like surfaces. An example energy of our framework is optimized by a tube that encloses a region that has locally similar diffusion patterns, which differ from the diffusion patterns immediately outside. Modeling the CB as a tube-like surface is a natural shape prior. Since a tube is characterized by a center-line and a radius function, the method is reduced to a 4D (center-line plus radius) curve evolution that is computationally much less costly than an arbitrary surface evolution. The method also provides the center-line of CB, which is potentially of clinical significance.},

An estimation method that accounts for the positive definiteness is desirable to respect the underlying principle of diffusion. This paper proposes such an estimation method and provides a theoretical interpretation of the result. A closed-form solution is derived that is the optimal data-fit in the matrix 2-norm sense, removing the need for optimization-based tensor estimation.},

The resulting energy distributions, however, suffer from the uncertainty principle, which complicates the allocation of energy to individual propagation modes (especially when the dispersion curves of these modes are close to each other in the time-frequency domain). This research applies the chirplet as a tool to analyze dispersive wave signals based on a dispersion model. The chirplet transform, a generalization of both the wavelet and the short-time Fourier transform, enables the extraction of components of a signal with a particular instantaneous frequency and group delay. An adaptive algorithm identifies frequency regions for which quantitative statements can be made about an individual model's energy, and employs chirplets (locally adapted to a dispersion curve model) to extract the (proportional) energy distribution of that single mode from a multimode dispersive wave signal. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated on a multimode synthetic Lamb wave signal for which the ground-truth energy distribution is known for each mode. Finally, the robustness of this algorithm is demonstrated on real, experimentally measured Lamb wave signals by an adaption of a correlation technique developed in previous research.},

Multiple simulation models are proposed for state prediction. Measurements are performed through standard static segmentation algorithms and optical-flow computations. Special emphasis is given to the geometric formulation of the overall dynamical system. The discrete-time measurements lead to the problem of geometric curve interpolation and the discrete-time filtering of quantities propagated along with the estimated curve. Interpolation and filtering are intimately linked to the correspondence problem between curves. Correspondences are established by a Laplace-equation approach. The proposed scheme is implemented completely implicitly (by Eulerian numerical solutions of transport equations) and thus naturally allows for topological changes and subpixel accuracy on the computational grid.},

Incorporating velocity information for every point on a curve lifts the originally two dimensional problem to four dimensions, and thus to a codimeusion three problem. Since basic level set approaches implicitly describe codimension one hypersurfaces, we introduce two methods suitable for codimension three problems within a level set framework. The partial level set approach, which propagates velocity information along with the curve by solving two additional transport equations, and the full level set approach, which is formulated by means of a vector distance function evolution equation. The full level set approach allow for complete topological flexibility (including intersecting curves in the image plane). However, it is computationally expensive. The partial level set approach compromises the topological flexibility for computational efficiency. In particular, the full level set ap proacb has the potential for tracking objects throughout occlusions, when combined with a suitable collision detection algorithm.},

A specific TFR, the reassigned spectrogram, is used to resolve the dispersion curves of the individual modes of the plate, and then the slowness-frequency representation (SFR) of the plate is calculated from this reassigned spectrogram. By considering the notch to be an additional (second) source, the reflected and transmitted contributions of each Lamb mode are automatically identified using the SFRs. These results are then used to develop a quantitative understanding of the interaction of an incident Lamb wave with a notch, helping to identify mode conversion.

The guided circumferential waves are generated with a commercial finite element method (FEM) code. One objective of this work is to demonstrate the effectiveness of using sophisticated DSP techniques to describe the effect of scattering on dispersive waves, showing it is possible to characterize cracks systematically and accurately by quantifying this scattering effect.

	abstract = {In this note we investigate parameter identification for nonlinear continuous-time SISO systems, based on input/output data, where the output is assumed to be noise corrupted. Continuous-time identification requires (i) the estimation of derivatives of the output (which is nontrivial due to the influence of noise), a suitable measure thereof or a way to avoid them and (ii) methods for parameter estimation based on the measured data. Problem (i) is addressed by reviewing modulating functions and the concept of delayed state variable filters; furthermore a high-gain observer is introduced as an approach to provide the necessary derivative information. Its performance is investigated with respect to the modulating function and the delayed state variable filter approaches. Least-squares methods are assessed for continuous-time nonlinear identification (problem (ii)). It is shown that parameter identification based in modulating functions and a standard least-squares method does not guarantee bias-free estimates for some systems. Whereas ordinary (or weighted) least-squares is sufficient for parameter identification by means of modulating functions it is not for the delayed state variable filter and the high-gain observer approaches (due to dependencies between error terms). Requirements on least-squares methods for nonlinear continuous-time system identification are discusses and a solution for bilinear systems is given. The importance of an appropriate least-squares method is underlined by parameter identification for a simulated bilinear example system.

	abstract = {This brief note reports on a study that applies the reassigned spectrogram (the reassigned energy density spectrum of the short-time Fourier transform [STFT]) to develop the dispersion curves for multimode Lamb waves propagating in an aluminum plate. The proposed procedure first uses the spectrogram to operate on a single, laser-generated and detected waveform to develop the dispersion relationship for this plate. Next, a reassignment procedure is used to refine the time-frequency resolution of the calculated dispersion curves. This reassignment operation clarifies the definition of the measured modes. This study demonstrates that the reassigned spectrogram is capable of distinguishing multiple, closely spaced Lamb modes in the ultrasonic frequency range.},

  abstract = {Voxel-based analysis provides a simple, easy to interpret approach to discover
regions correlated with a variable of interest such as for example a pathology
indicator. Voxel-based analysis methods perform a statistical test at each
voxel and are prone to false positives due to multiple testing, or when
corrected for multiple testing may miss regions of interest. Component based
approaches, such as principal or independent component analysis provide an
approach to mitigate multiple testing, by testing for correlations to projections
of the data to the components. We propose a spatially regularized component
analysis approach to find components for image data sets that are spatially
localized and smooth. We show that the proposed approach leads to components
that are easier to interpret and can improve predictive performance
when used with linear regression models. We develop an efficient optimization
approach using the Grassmannian projection kernel and a randomized SVD. The
proposed optimization is capable to deal with data sets to large too fit all at
once into memory. We demonstrate the approach with an application to study
Alzheimer's disease using over 1200 images from the OASIS-3 data set.},

  booktitle = 	 {Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention - {MICCAI}},
  year = 	 {2020},
  abstract = {Perfusion imaging (PI) is clinically used to assess strokes and brain tumors. Commonly used PI approaches based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) image the effect of a contrast agent moving through blood vessels and into tissue. Contrast-agent free approaches, for example, based on intravoxel incoherent motion, also exist, but are so far not routinely used clinically. MR or CT perfusion imaging based on contrast agents relies on the estimation of the arterial input function (AIF) to approximately model tissue perfusion, neglecting spatial dependencies. Reliably estimating the AIF is also non-trivial, leading to difficulties with standardizing perfusion measures. In this work we therefore propose a data-assimilation approach (PIANO) which estimates the velocity and diffusion fields of an advection-diffusion model best explaining the contrast dynamics. PIANO accounts for spatial dependencies and neither requires estimating the AIF nor relies on a particular contrast agent bolus shape. Specifically, we propose a convenient parameterization of the estimation problem, a numerical estimation approach, and extensively evaluate PIANO. We demonstrate that PIANO can successfully resolve velocity and diffusion field ambiguities and results in sensitive measures for the assessment of stroke, comparing favorably to conventional measures of perfusion.},

  booktitle = 	 {Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention - {MICCAI}},
  year = 	 {2020},
  abstract = {Registration is widely used in image-guided therapy and image-guided surgery to estimate spatial correspondences between organs of interest between planning and treatment images. However, while high-quality computed tomography (CT) images are often available at planning time, limited angle acquisitions are frequently used during treatment because of radiation concerns or imaging time constraints. This requires algorithms to register CT images based on limited angle acquisitions. We, therefore, formulate a 3D/2D registration approach which infers a 3D deformation based on measured projections and digitally reconstructed radiographs of the CT. Most 3D/2D registration approaches use simple transformation models or require complex mathematical derivations to formulate the underlying optimization problem. Instead, our approach entirely relies on differentiable operations which can be combined with modern computational toolboxes supporting automatic differentiation. This then allows for rapid prototyping, integration with deep neural networks, and to support a variety of transformation models including fluid flow models. We demonstrate our approach for the registration between CT and stationary chest tomosynthesis (sDCT) images and show how it naturally leads to an iterative image reconstruction approach.},

  abstract = {We introduce a fluid-based image augmentation method for medical image analysis. In contrast to existing methods, our framework generates anatomically meaningful images via interpolation from the geodesic subspace underlying given samples. Our approach consists of three steps: 1) given a source image and a set of target images, we construct a geodesic subspace using the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) model; 2) we sample transformations from the resulting geodesic subspace; 3) we obtain deformed images and segmentations via interpolation. Experiments on brain (LPBA) and knee (OAI) data illustrate the performance of our approach on two tasks: 1) data augmentation during training and testing for image segmentation; 2) one-shot learning for single atlas image segmentation. We demonstrate that our approach generates anatomically meaningful data and improves performance on these tasks over competing approaches.},

  abstract = {Deep learning models have been successful in computer vision and medical image analysis. However, training these models frequently requires large labeled image sets whose creation is often very time and labor intensive, for example, in the context of 3D segmentations. Approaches capable of training deep segmentation networks with a limited number of labeled samples are therefore highly desirable. Data augmentation or semi-supervised approaches are commonly used to cope with limited labeled training data. However, the augmentation strategies for many existing approaches are either hand-engineered or require computationally demanding searches. To that end, we explore an augmentation strategy which builds statistical deformation models from unlabeled data via principal component analysis and uses the resulting statistical deformation space to augment the labeled training samples. Specifically, we obtain transformations via deep registration models. This allows for an intuitive control over plausible deformation magnitudes via the statistical model and, if combined with an appropriate deformation model, yields spatially regular transformations. To optimally augment a dataset we use an adversarial strategy integrated into our statistical deformation model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for the segmentation of knee cartilage from 3D magnetic resonance images. We show favorable performance to state-of-the-art augmentation approaches. },

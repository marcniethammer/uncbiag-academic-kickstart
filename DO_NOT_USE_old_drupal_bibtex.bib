	year = {2017},
	abstract = {<p>Image segmentation is a fundamental task for extracting semantically meaningful regions from an image. The goal is to assign object labels to each image location. Due to image-noise, shortcomings of algorithms and other ambiguities in the images, there is uncertainty in the assigned labels. In multiple application domains, estimates of this uncertainty are important. For example, object segmentation and uncertainty quantification is essential for many medical application, including tumor segmentation for radiation treatment planning. While a Bayesian characterization of the label posterior provides estimates of segmentation uncertainty, Bayesian approaches can be computationally prohibitive for practical applications. On the other hand, typical optimization based algorithms are computationally very efficient, but only provide maximum a-posteriori solutions and hence no estimates of label uncertainty. In this paper, we propose Active Mean Fields (AMF), a Bayesian technique that uses a mean-field approximation to derive an efficient segmentation and uncertainty quantification algorithm. This model, which allows combining any label-likelihood measure with a boundary length prior, yields a variational formulation that is convex. A specific implementation of that model is the Chan--Vese segmentation model (CV), which formulates the binary segmentation problem through Gaussian likelihoods combined with a boundary-length regularizer. Furthermore, the Euler--Lagrange equations derived from the AMF model are equivalent to those of the popular Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model for image de-noising. Solutions to the AMF model can thus be implemented by directly utilizing highly-efficient ROF solvers on log-likelihood ratio fields. We demonstrate the approach using synthetic data, as well as real medical images (for heart and prostate segmentations), and on standard computer vision test images.</p>

	title = {AGA: Attribute Guided Augmentation},
	year = {2017},
	abstract = {<p>We consider the problem of data augmentation, i.e., generating artificial samples to extend a given corpus of training data. Specifically, we propose attributed-guided augmentation (AGA) which learns a mapping that allows to synthesize data such that an attribute of a synthesized sample is at a desired value or strength. This is particularly interesting in situations where little data with no attribute annotation is available for learning, but we have access to a large external corpus of heavily annotated samples. While prior works primarily augment in the space of images, we propose to perform augmentation in feature space instead. We implement our approach as a deep encoderdecoder architecture that learns the synthesis function in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the problems of (1) one-shot object recognition in a transfer-learning setting where we have no prior knowledge of the new classes, as well as (2) object-based oneshot scene recognition. As external data, we leverage 3D depth and pose information from the SUN RGB-D dataset. Our experiments show that attribute-guided augmentation of high-level CNN features considerably improves one-shot recognition performance on both problems.</p>

	title = {Brain Extraction from Normal and Pathological Images: A Joint PCA/Image-Reconstruction Approach},
	year = {2017},
	abstract = {<p>Brain extraction from 3D medical images is a common pre-processing step. A variety of approaches exist, but they are frequently only designed to perform brain extraction from images without strong pathologies. Extracting the brain from images exhibiting strong pathologies, for example, the presence of a brain tumor or of a traumatic brain injury (TBI), is challenging. In such cases, tissue appearance may substantially deviate from normal tissue appearance and hence violates algorithmic assumptions for standard approaches to brain extraction; consequently, the brain may not be correctly extracted.</p>

<p>This paper proposes a brain extraction approach which can explicitly account for pathologies by jointly modeling normal tissue appearance and pathologies. Specifically, our model uses a three-part image de- composition: (1) normal tissue appearance is captured by a statistical appearance model (via principal component analysis (PCA)), (2) pathologies are captured via a total variation term, and (3) the skull and surrounding tissue is captured by a sparsity term. Due to its convexity, the resulting decomposition model allows for efficient optimization. Decomposition and image registration steps are alternated to allow statistical modeling of normal tissue appearance in a fixed atlas coordinate system. As a beneficial side effect, the decomposition model allows for the identification of potentially pathological areas and the reconstruction of a quasi-normal image in atlas space.</p>

<p>We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four datasets: the publicly available IBSR and LPBA40 datasets which show normal image appearance, the BRATS dataset containing imaging with brain tumors, and a dataset containing clinical TBI images. We compare the performance with other popular brain extraction models: ROBEX, BET, BSE and a recently proposed deep learning approach. Our model performs better than these competing approaches on all four datasets. Hence, our approach is an effective method for brain extraction for a wide variety of images with high-quality brain extraction results.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Community detection is a commonly used technique for identifying groups in a network based on similarities in connectivity patterns. To facilitate community detection in large networks, we recast the network to be partitioned into a smaller network of {\textquoteright}super nodes{\textquoteright}, each super node comprising one or more nodes in the original network. To define the seeds of our super nodes, we apply the {\textquoteright}CoreHD{\textquoteright} ranking from dismantling and decycling. We test our approach through the analysis of two common methods for community detection: modularity maximization with the Louvain algorithm and maximum likelihood optimization for fitting a stochastic block model. Our results highlight that applying community detection to the compressed network of super nodes is significantly faster while successfully producing partitions that are more aligned with the local network connectivity, more stable across multiple (stochastic) runs within and between community detection algorithms, and overlap well with the results obtained using the full network.</p>

	year = {2017},
	abstract = {<p>Inferring topological and geometrical information from data can offer an alternative perspective on machine learning problems. Methods from topological data analysis, e.g., persistent homology, enable us to obtain such information, typically in the form of summary representations of topological features. However, such topological signatures often come with an unusual structure (e.g., multisets of intervals) that is highly impractical for most machine learning techniques. While many strategies have been proposed to map these topological signatures into machine learning compatible representations, they suffer from being agnostic to the target learning task. In contrast, we propose a technique that enables us to input topological signatures to deep neural networks and learn a task-optimal representation during training. Our approach is realized as a novel input layer with favorable theoretical properties. Classification experiments on 2D object shapes and social network graphs demonstrate the versatility of the approach and, in case of the latter, we even outperform the state-of-the-art by a large margin.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Registration involving one or more images containing pathologies is challenging, as standard image similarity measures and spatial transforms cannot account for common changes due to pathologies. Low-rank/Sparse (LRS) decomposition removes pathologies prior to registration; however, LRS is memory-demanding and slow, which limits its use on larger data sets. Additionally, LRS blurs normal tissue regions, which may degrade registration performance. This paper proposes an efficient alternative to LRS: (1) normal tissue appearance is captured by principal component analysis (PCA) and (2) blurring is avoided by an integrated model for pathology removal and image reconstruction. Results on synthetic and BRATS 2015 data demonstrate its utility.</p>

	abstract = {<p>We introduce a deep encoder-decoder architecture for image deformation prediction from multimodal images. Specifically, we design an image-patch-based deep network that jointly (i) learns an image similarity measure and (ii) the relationship between image patches and deformation parameters. While our method can be applied to general image registration formulations, we focus on the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) registration model. By predicting the initial momentum of the shooting formulation of LDDMM, we preserve its mathematical properties and drastically reduce the computation time, compared to optimization-based approaches. Furthermore, we create a Bayesian probabilistic version of the network that allows evaluation of registration uncertainty via sampling of the network at test time. We evaluate our method on a 3D brain MRI dataset using both T1- and T2-weighted images. Our experiments show that our method generates accurate predictions and that learning the similarity measure leads to more consistent registrations than relying on generic multimodal image similarity measures, such as mutual information. Our approach is an order of magnitude faster than optimization-based LDDMM.</p>

Traditional approaches usually assume uniform isotropic tissue elasticity (a constant regularization weight) across the whole domain, which contradicts human tissue elasticity being not only inhomogeneous but also anisotropic. We focus on producing more physically realistic deformations for the task of surface registration. We model the surface as an orthotropic elastic thin shell, and we propose a novel statistical framework to estimate inhomogeneous and anisotropic shell elasticity parameters only from a group of known surface deformations. With this framework we show that a joint estimation of within-patient surface deformations and the shell elasticity parameters can improve groupwise registration accuracy.

Quicksilver registration for image-pairs works by patch-wise prediction of a deformation model based directly on image appearance. A deep encoder-decoder network is used as the prediction model. While the prediction strategy is general, we focus on predictions for the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) model. Specifically, we predict the momentum-parameterization of LDDMM, which facilitates a patch-wise prediction strategy while maintaining the theoretical properties of LDDMM, such as guaranteed diffeomorphic mappings for sufficiently strong regularization. We also provide a probabilistic version of our prediction network which can be sampled during test time to calculate uncertainties in the predicted deformations. Finally, we introduce a new correction network which greatly increases the prediction accuracy of an already existing prediction network. Experiments are conducted for both atlas-to-image and image-to-image registrations. These experiments show that our method accurately predicts registrations obtained by numerical optimization, is very fast, and achieves state-of-the-art registration results on four standard validation datasets.

In their simplest manifestation, these regression models are formulated in Rn. However, in the context of imaging studies, the objects of interest which are to be regressed are frequently best modeled as elements of a Riemannian manifold. Regression on such spaces can be accomplished through geodesic regression. This paper develops an approach to compute confidence intervals for geodesic regression models. The approach is general, but illustrated and specifically developed for the Grassmann manifold, which allows us, e.g., to regress shapes or linear dynamical systems. Extensions to other manifolds can be obtained in a similar manner. We demonstrate our approach for regression with 2D/3D shapes using synthetic and real data.</p>

We introduce a pipeline for automatically reconstructing a textured 3D surface model, which we call an endoscopogram, from multiple 2D endoscopic video frames. Our pipeline first reconstructs a partial 3D surface model for each input individual 2D frame. In the next step (which is the focus of this paper), we generate a single high-quality 3D surface model using a groupwise registration approach that fuses multiple, partially overlapping, incomplete and deformed surface models together. We generate endoscopograms from synthetic, phantom, and patient data and show that our registration approach can account for tissue deformations and reconstruction inconsistency across endoscopic video frames.</p>

In particular, we leverage a recently introduced dataset with fine-grain annotations to estimate feature trajectories for a collection of transient attributes and then show how these trajectories can be transferred to new image representations. This enables us to synthesize new data along the transferred trajectories with respect to the dimensions of the space spanned by the transient attributes.

These capabilities are particularly relevant to point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications, where operator experience with ultrasound may be limited.

	abstract = {<p>This paper presents a method for automatic color and intensity normalization of digitized histology slides stained with two different agents. In comparison to previous approaches, prior information on the stain vectors is used in the plane estimation process, resulting in improved stability of the estimates. Due to the prevalence of hematoxylin and eosin staining for histology slides, the proposed method has significant practical utility. In particular, it can be used as a first step to standardize appearance across slides and is effective at countering effects due to differing stain amounts and protocols and counteracting slide fading. The approach is validated against non-prior plane-fitting using synthetic experiments and 13 real datasets. Results of application of the method to adjustment of faded slides are given, and the effectiveness of the method in aiding statistical classification is shown.</p>

	journal = {IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging},
	year = {2015},
	abstract = {<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an important imaging technique for quantifying the spatial location and magnitude/direction of longitudinal cartilage morphology changes in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Although several analytical methods, such as subregion-based analysis, have been developed to refine and improve quantitative cartilage analyses, they can be suboptimal due to two major issues: the lack of spatial correspondence across subjects and time and the spatial heterogeneity of cartilage progression across subjects. The aim of this paper is to present a statistical method for longitudinal cartilage quantification in OA patients, while addressing these two issues. The 3D knee image data is preprocessed to establish spatial correspondence across subjects and/or time. Then, a Gaussian hidden Markov model (GHMM) is proposed to deal with the spatial heterogeneity of cartilage progression across both time and OA subjects. To estimate unknown parameters in GHMM, we employ a pseudo-likelihood function and optimize it by using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed model can effectively detect diseased regions in each OA subject and present a localized analysis of longitudinal cartilage thickness within each latent subpopulation. Our GHMM integrates the strengths of two standard statistical methods including the local subregion-based analysis and the ordered value approach. We use simulation studies and the Pfizer longitudinal knee MRI dataset to evaluate the finite sample performance of GHMM in the quantification of longitudinal cartilage morphology changes. Our results indicate that GHMM significantly outperforms several standard analytical methods.</p>

	note = {<p>accepted for publication</p>
},
	abstract = {<p>We present a common framework, for registering images to an atlas and for forming an unbiased atlas, that tolerates the presence of pathologies such as tumors and traumatic brain injury lesions. This common framework is particularly useful when a sufficient number of protocol-matched scans from healthy subjects cannot be easily acquired for atlas formation and when the pathologies in a patient cause large appearance changes. Our framework combines a low-rank-plus-sparse image decomposition technique with an iterative, diffeomorphic, group-wise image registration method. At each iteration of image registration, the decomposition technique estimates a {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}healthy\&quot; version of each image as its low-rank component and estimates the pathologies in each image as its sparse component. The healthy version of each image is used for the next iteration of image registration. The low-rank and sparse estimates are refined as the image registrations iteratively improve. When that framework is applied to image-to-atlas registration, the low-rank image is registered to a pre-defined atlas, to establish correspondence that is independent of the pathologies in the sparse component of each image. Ultimately, image-to-atlas registrations can be used to define spatial priors for tissue segmentation and to map information across subjects. When that framework is applied to unbiased atlas formation, at each iteration, the average of the low-rank images from the patients is used as the atlas image for the next iteration, until convergence. Since each iteration\&$\#$39;s atlas is comprised of low-rank components, it provides a population-consistent, pathology-free appearance. Evaluations of the proposed methodology are presented using synthetic data as well as simulated and clinical tumor MRI images from the brain tumor segmentation (BRATS) challenge from MICCAI 2012.</p>

	year = {2015},
	abstract = {<p>Reliable estimation of model parameters from data requires a suitable model. In this work, we investigate and extend a recent model criticism approach to evaluate regression models on the Grassmann manifold. Model criticism allows us to check if a model fits and if the underlying model assumptions are justified by the observed data. This is a critical step to check model validity which is often neglected in practice. Using synthetic data we demonstrate that the proposed model criticism approach can indeed reject models that are improper for observed data and that the approach can guide the model selection process. We study two real applications: degeneration of corpus callosum shapes during aging and developmental shape changes in the rat calvarium. Our experimental results suggest that the three tested regression models on the Grassmannian (equivalent to linear, time-warped, and cubic-spline regression in R^n, respectively) can all capture changes of the corpus callosum, but only the cubic-spline model is appropriate for shape changes of the rat calvarium. While our approach is developed for the Grassmannian, the principles are applicable to smooth manifolds in general.</p>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart and imaging review. SETTING: Tertiary Care Hospital SUBJECTS AND METHODS: CT scans of children (n=17) with SGS were analyzed by geometric and (CFD) methods. Polysomnograms (n=15) were also analyzed. CT\&rsquo;s were also analyzed by age/weight flow normalization and comparison to an Atlas created from normal CT\&rsquo;s. Five geometric, seven CFD, and five PSG measures were analyzed to determine their correlation with which patients received surgery subsequent to the CT/PSG dataset versus those who did not. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sample t-test with Bonferroni correction and area under the curve analysis. RESULTS: Two geometric indices and one CFD measure were significant for determining which children with SGS received surgery. Polysomnography was less helpful in this determination. Optimal cutoffs for these values were determined from this dataset. CONCLUSIONS: A number of geometric and CFD variables were sensitive at determining which patients with SGS received surgical intervention versus those who did not. Polysomnography was less helpful in making this determination. Discrete, quantitative assessment of the pediatric airway was performed, yielding preliminary data regarding possible objective thresholds for surgical versus non-surgical treatment of disease. This study is limited by its small, retrospective, single institution nature; further studies to validate these findings and possibly optimize treatment threshold recommendations are warranted.</p>

The proposed method is based on our earlier template based registration that estimates a continuous, smooth deformation field via sulcal curve-constrained registration employing spherical harmonic decomposition of the deformation field. This pairwise registration though results in a well-known template selection bias, which we aim to overcome here via a group-wise approach. We propose the use of an unbiased ensemble entropy minimization following the use of the pairwise registration as an initialization. An individual deformation field is then iteratively updated onto the unbiased average. For the optimization, we use metrics specific for cortical correspondence though all of these are straightforwardly extendable to the generic setting: The first focused on optimizing the correspondence of automatically extracted sulcal landmarks and the second on that of sulcal depth property maps. We further propose a robust entropy metric and a hierarchical optimization by employing spherical harmonic basis orthogonality. We also provide the detailed methodological description of both our earlier work and the proposed method with a set of experiments on a population of human and non-human primate subjects. In the experiment, we have shown that our method achieves superior results on consistency through quantitative and visual comparisons as compared to the existing methods.</p>

We present a principled way to define curves with nonzero acceleration and nonzero jerk. This work extends methods based on geodesics which have been developed during the last decade for computational anatomy in the large deformation diffeomorphic image analysis framework. In contrast to previously proposed methods to capture image changes over time, such as geodesic regression, the proposed method can capture more complex spatio-temporal deformations. We take a variational approach that is governed by an underlying energy formulation, which respects the nonflat geometry of diffeomorphisms. Such an approach of minimal energy curve estimation also provides a physical analogy to particle motion under a varying force field. This gives rise to the notion of the quadratic, the cubic and the piecewise cubic splines on the manifold of diffeomorphisms. The variational formulation of splines also allows for the use of temporal control points to control spline behavior. This necessitates the development of a shooting formulation for splines. The initial conditions of our proposed shooting polynomial paths in diffeomorphisms are analogous to the Euclidean polynomial coefficients. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of using the parametric curves both for synthesizing polynomial paths and for regression of imaging data. The performance of the method is compared to geodesic regression.</p>

While several avenues towards a statistical treatment of the diagrams have been explored recently, we follow an alternative route that is motivated by the success of methods based on the embedding of probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. In fact, a positive definite kernel on persistence diagrams has recently been proposed, connecting persistent homology to popular kernel-based learning techniques such as support vector machines. However, important properties of that kernel which would enable a principled use in the context of probability measure embeddings remain to be explored. Our contribution is to close this gap by proving universality of a variant of the original kernel, and to demonstrate its effective use in two-sample hypothesis testing on synthetic as well as real-world data.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of joint disease and often characterized by cartilage changes. Accurate quantitative methods are needed to rapidly screen large image databases to assess changes in cartilage morphology. We therefore propose a new automatic atlas-based cartilage segmentation method for future automatic OA studies. Atlas-based segmentation methods have been demonstrated to be robust and accurate in brain imaging and therefore also hold high promise to allow for reliable and high-quality segmentations of cartilage. Nevertheless, atlas-based methods have not been well explored for cartilage segmentation. A particular challenge is the thinness of cartilage, its relatively small volume in comparison to surrounding tissue and the difficulty to locate cartilage interfaces -- for example the interface between femoral and tibial cartilage. This paper focuses on the segmentation of femoral and tibial cartilage, proposing a multi-atlas segmentation strategy with non-local patch-based label fusion which can robustly identify candidate regions of cartilage. This method is combined with a novel three-label segmentation method which guarantees the spatial separation of femoral and tibial cartilage, and ensures spatial regularity while preserving the thin cartilage shape through anisotropic regularization. Our segmentation energy is convex and therefore guarantees globally optimal solutions. We perform an extensive validation of the proposed method on 706 images of the Pfizer Longitudinal Study. Our validation includes comparisons of different atlas segmentation strategies, different local classifiers, and different types of regularizers. To compare to other cartilage segmentation approaches we validate based on the 50 images of the SKI10 dataset.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis; it is characterized by the loss of cartilage. Automatic quantitative methods are needed to screen large image databases to assess changes in cartilage morphology. This dissertation presents an automatic analysis method to quantitatively analyze longitudinal cartilage changes from knee magnetic resonance (MR) images. A novel robust automatic cartilage segmentation method is proposed to overcome the limitations of existing cartilage segmentation methods. The dissertation presents a new and general convex three-label segmentation approach to ensure the separation of touching objects, i.e., femoral and tibial cartilage. Anisotropic spatial regularization is introduced to avoid over-regularization by isotropic regularization on thin objects. Temporal regularization is further incorporated to encourage temporally-consistent segmentations across time points for longitudinal data. The state-of-the-art analysis of cartilage changes relies on the subdivision of cartilage, which is coarse and purely geometric whereas cartilage loss is a local thinning process and exhibits spatial nonuniformity. A statistical analysis method is proposed to study localized longitudinal cartilage thickness changes by establishing spatial correspondences across time and between subjects. The method is general and can be applied to nonuniform morphological changes in other diseases.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Registration plays an important role in group analysis of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data. It helps build a white matter anatomy that is crucial for investigating variation or tracking changes in white matter within a population. Unlike traditional scalar image registration where spatial alignment is the only focus, registration of DWI data requires both spatial alignment of structures and reorientation of local diffusivity profiles. As such, DWI registration is much more complex and challenging than scalar image registration. Although a variety of algorithms has been proposed to tackle the problem, most of them are restricted by the diffusion model used for registration, making it difficult to fit to the registered data a different model. In this paper we describe a method that allows any diffusion model to be fitted after registration for subsequent multifaceted analysis. This is achieved by directly aligning DWI data using a large deformation diffeomorphic registration framework. Our algorithm seeks the optimal coordinate mapping by simultaneously considering structural alignment, local diffusivity profile reorientation, and deformation regularization. Our algorithm also incorporates a multikernel strategy to concurrently register anatomical structures of different scales. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using in vivo data and report detailed qualitative and quantitative results in comparison with several different registration strategies.</p>

It segments tumor, resection cavity, and recurrence based on models specific to each scan. PORTR then uses the resulting maps to exclude pathological regions from the image-based correspondence term while simultaneously measuring the overlap between the aligned tumor and resection cavity. Embedded into a symmetric registration framework, we determine the optimal solution by taking advantage of both discrete and continuous search methods. We apply our method to scans of 24 glioma patients. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results clearly show that our method is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

	abstract = {<p>This paper presents a novel mathematical framework for representing uncertainty in large deformation diffeomorphic image registration. The Bayesian posterior distribution over the deformations aligning a moving and a fixed image is approximated via a variational formulation. A stochastic differential equation (SDE) modeling the deformations as the evolution of a time-varying velocity field leads to a prior density over deformations in the form of a Gaussian process. This permits estimating the full posterior distribution in order to represent uncertainty, in contrast to methods in which the posterior is approximated via Monte Carlo sampling or maximized in maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimation. The framework is demonstrated in the case of landmark-based image registration, including simulated data and annotated pre and intra-operative 3D images.</p>

	abstract = {<p>This paper describes a system for interpreting a scene by assigning a semantic label at every pixel and inferring the spatial extent of individual object instances together with their occlusion relationships. First we present a method for labeling each pixel aimed at achieving broad coverage across hundreds of object categories, many of them sparsely sampled. This method combines region-level features with per-exemplar sliding window detectors. Unlike traditional bounding box detectors, per-exemplar detectors perform well on classes with little training data and high intra-class variation, and they allow object masks to be transferred into the test image for pixel-level segmentation. Next, we use per-exemplar detections to generate a set of candidate object masks for a given test image. We then select a subset of objects that explain the image well and have valid overlap relationships and occlusion ordering. This is done by minimizing an integer quadratic program either using a greedy method or a standard solver. We alternate between using the object predictions to refine the pixel labels and using the pixel labels to improve the object predictions. The proposed system obtains promising results on two challenging subsets of the LabelMe dataset, the largest of which contains 45,676 images and 232 classes.</p>

Starting from a variational formulation of splines the proposed approach allows for the use of temporal control points to control spline behavior.

	abstract = {<p>Atlas-building from population data is widely used in medical imaging. However, the emphasis of atlas-building approaches is typically to estimate a spatial alignment to compute a mean / median shape or image based on population data. In this work, we focus on the statistical characterization of the population data, once spatial alignment has been achieved. We introduce and propose the use of the weighted functional boxplot. This allows the generalization of concepts such as the median, percentiles, or outliers to spaces where the data objects are functions, shapes, or images, and allows spatio-temporal atlas-building based on kernel regression. In our experiments, we demonstrate the utility of the approach to construct statistical atlases for pediatric upper airways and corpora callosa revealing their growth patterns. We also define a score system based on the pediatric airway atlas to quantitatively measure the severity of subglottic stenosis (SGS) in the airway. This scoring allows the classification of pre- and post-surgery SGS subjects and radiographically normal controls. Experimental results show the utility of atlas information to assess the effect of airway surgery in children.</p>

Our focus in this paper is therefore to keep the model and its inference as simple as possible while allowing to capture expected biological variation. We demonstrate that by augmenting geodesic regression with parametric time-warp functions, we can achieve comparable flexibility to more complex models while retaining model simplicity. In addition, the time-warp parameters provide useful information of underlying anatomical changes as demonstrated for the analysis of corpora callosa and rat calvariae. We exemplify our strategy for shape regression on the Grassmann manifold, but note that the method is generally applicable for time-warped geodesic regression.},

Estimation of the weights of the RBF\&rsquo;s is done by enforcing positivity constraint on the estimated ADP or ODF.

Yet the lack of a normative description has limited the direct comparison with changes in humans. This paper presents for the first time a cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study characterizing primate brain neurodevelopment between 1 and 6 years of age on 25 healthy undisturbed rhesus monkeys (14 male, 11 female). A comprehensive analysis including region-of-interest, voxel-wise, and fiber tract-based approach demonstrated significant changes of DTI properties over time. Changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) exhibited a heterogeneous pattern across different regions as well as along fiber tracts. Most of these patterns are similar to those from human studies yet a few followed unique patterns. Overall, we observed substantial increase in FA and AD and a decrease in RD for white matter (WM) along with similar yet smaller changes in gray matter (GM). We further observed an overall posterior-to-anterior trend in DTI property changes over time and strong correlations between WM and GM development. These DTI trends provide crucial insights into underlying age-related biological maturation, including myelination, axonal density changes, fiber tract reorganization, and synaptic pruning processes.</p>

A hidden Markov random field (HMRF) is proposed to extract such latent subpopulation structure. The EM algorithm and pseudo-likelihood method are both considered in making statistical inference. The proposed model can effectively detect diseased regions and present a localized analysis of longitudinal cartilage thickness within each latent subpopulation.

A common approach to using MR images for AD detection is to spatially normalize the images by non-rigid image registration, and then perform statistical analysis on the resulting deformation fields. Due to the high nonlinearity of the deformation field, recent studies suggest to use initial momentum instead as it lies in a linear space and fully encodes the deformation field. In this paper we explore the use of initial momentum for image classification by focusing on the problem of AD detection. Experiments on the public ADNI dataset show that the initial momentum, together with a simple sparse coding technique\&mdash;locality-constrained linear coding (LLC)\&mdash;can achieve a classification accuracy that is comparable to or even better than the state of the art.We also show that the performance of LLC can be greatly improved by introducing proper weights to the codebook.</p>

Validation was performed using synthetic, phantom, and 14 clinical datasets, including the publicly available DIR-Lab dataset. We show that motion discontinuities caused by sliding can be effectively recovered, unlike conventional regularizations that enforce globally smooth motion. In the clinical datasets, target registration error showed improved accuracy for lung landmarks compared to the diffusive regularization. We also present a generalization of our algorithm to other sliding geometries, including sliding tubes (e.g., needles sliding through tissue, or contrast agent flowing through a vessel).

Hence, (i) local similarity measures, (ii) methods estimating intensity transformations between images, and (iii) metamorphosis approaches have been developed to either achieve robustness with respect to intensity changes or to simultaneously capture spatial and intensity changes. For these methods, longitudinal intensity changes are not explicitly modeled and images are treated as independent static samples.

Hence, the registration between two different types of microscopy images can be transformed to a mono-modality image registration. We use a sparse representation model to obtain image analogies. The method makes use of corresponding image training patches of two different imaging modalities to learn a dictionary capturing appearance relations. We test our approach on backscattered electron (BSE) scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/confocal and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)/confocal images.

High-level information such as a desired area or volume, or a particular topology are only implicitly specified. In this paper we develop a segmentation method with explicit bounds on the segmented area. Area constraints allow for the soft selection of meaningful solutions, and can counteract the shrinking bias of length-based regularization. We analyze the intrinsic problems of convex relaxations proposed in the literature for segmentation with size constraints. Hence, we formulate the area-constrained segmentation task as a mixed integer program, propose a branch and bound method for exact minimization, and use convex relaxations to obtain the required lower energy bounds on candidate solutions. We also provide a numerical scheme to solve the convex subproblems. We demonstrate the method for segmentations of vesicles from electron tomography images.</p>

	abstract = {Anatomical changes like brain atrophy or growth are usually not homogeneous in space and across spatial scales, since they map differently depending on the anatomical structures. Thus, the accurate analysis of volume changes from medical images requires to reliably localize and distinguish the spatial changes occurring at different scales, from voxel to regional level. We propose here a framework for the sparse probabilistic scale-space analysis of volume changes encoded by deformations. Our framework is based on the Helmholtz decomposition of vector fields. By scale-space analysis of the scalar pressure map associated to the irrotational component of the deformation, we robustly identify the areas of maximal volume changes, and we define a consistent sparse decomposition of the irrotational component. We show the effectiveness of our framework in the challenging problem of detecting the progression of tumor growth, and in the group-wise analysis of the longitudinal atrophy in Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease.},

Using graph-kernels then allows us to quantify graph similarity in a principled way. To demonstrate our approach, we assess the hypothesis that gender differences manifest as variations in the architecture of cerebral blood vessels, an observation that previously had only been tested and confirmed for the Circle of Willis.

We were successful in differentiating melanoma from nevi (ROC area 0.95) using image-derived features. Analysis revealed features related to nuclear size, shape, and distance between nuclei most important. Dividing melanoma into subtypes, even greater separation was obtained (ROC area 0.98 for superficial spreading melanoma; 0.95 for lentigo maligna melanoma; and 0.99 for unclassified). Severely dysplastic nevi were best differentiated from conventional and mildly dysplastic nevi by differences in cellular staining qualities (ROC area 0.84). We found that melanoma were separated from severely dysplastic nevi by features related to cell shape and cellular staining qualities (ROC area 0.95).

	abstract = {<p>Registration of Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data emerges as an important topic in magnetic resonance (MR) image analysis. As existing methods are often designed for specific diffusion models, it is difficult to fit to the registered data different models other than the one used for registration. In this paper we describe a diffeomorphic registration algorithm for DWI data under large deformation. Our method generates spatially normalized DWI data and it is thus possible to fit various diffusion models after registration for comparison purposes. Our algorithm includes (1) a reorientation component, where each diffusion profile (DWI signal as a function on a unit sphere) is decomposed, reoriented and recomposed to form the orientation-corrected DWI profile, and (2) a large deformation diffeomorphic registration component to ensure one-to-one mapping in a large-structural-variation scenario. In addition our algorithm uses a geodesic shooting mechanism to avoid the huge computational resources that are needed to register high-dimensional vector-valued data. We also incorporate into our algorithm a multi-kernel strategy where anatomical structures at different scales are considered simultaneously during registration. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using in vivo data.</p>

Our method is based on image analogies and allows to transform images of a given modality into the appearance-space of another modality. Hence, the registration between two di↵erent types of microscopy images can be transformed to a mono-modality image registration. We use a sparse representation model to obtain image analogies. The method makes use of representative corresponding image training patches of two different imaging modalities to learn a dictionary capturing appearance relations. We test our approach on backscattered electron (BSE) Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)/confocal and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)/confocal images and show improvements over direct registration using a mutual-information similarity measure to account for differences in image appearance.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Geodesic regression generalizes linear regression to general Riemannian manifolds. Applied to images, it allows for a compact approximation of an image time-series through an initial image and an initial momentum. Geodesic regression requires the definition of a squared residual (squared distance) between the regression geodesic and the measurement images. In principle, this squared distance should also be defined through a geodesic connecting an image on the regression geodesicto its respective measurement. However, in practice only standard registration distances (such as sum of squared distances) are used, to reduce computation time. This paper describes a simplified geodesic regression method which approximates the registration-based distances with respect to a fixed initial image. This results in dramatically simplified computations. In particular, the method becomes straightforward to implement using readily available large displacement diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) shooting algorithms and decouples the problem into pairwise image registrations allowing parallel computations. We evaluate the approach using 2D synthetic images and real 3D brain images.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Estimation of tissue stiffness is an important means of noninvasive cancer detection. Existing elasticity reconstruction methods usually depend on a dense displacement field (inferred from ultrasound orMR images) and known external forces.Many imaging modalities, however, cannot provide details within an organ and therefore cannot provide such a displacement field. Furthermore, force exertion and measurement can be difficult for some internal organs, making boundary forces another missing parameter. We propose a general method for estimating elasticity and boundary forces automatically using an iterative optimization framework, given the desired (target) output surface. During the optimization, the input model is deformed by the simulator, and an objective function based on the distance between the deformed surface and the target surface is minimized numerically. The optimization framework does not depend on a particular simulation method and is therefore suitable for different physical models. We show a positive correlation between clinical prostate cancer stage (a clinical measure of severity) and the recovered elasticity of the organ. Since the surface correspondence is established, our method also provides a non-rigid image registration, where the quality of the deformation fields is guaranteed, as they are computed using a physics-based simulation.</p>

	The human cerebral cortex is one of the most complicated structures in the body. It has a highly convoluted structure with much of the cortical sheet buried in sulci. Based on cytoarchitectural and functional imaging studies, it is possible to segment the cerebral cortex into several subregions. While it is only possible to differentiate the true anatomical subregions based on cytoarchitecture, the surface morphometry aligns closely with the underlying cytoarchitecture and provides features that allow the surface of the cortex to be parcellated based on the sulcal and gyral patterns that are readily visible on the MR images. We have developed a fully automated pipeline for the generation and registration of cortical surfaces in the spherical domain. The pipeline initiates with the BRAINS AutoWorkup pipeline. Subsequently, topology correction and surface generation is performed to generate a genus zero surface and mapped to a sphere. Several surface features are then calculated to drive the registration between the atlas surface and other datasets. A spherical diffeomorphic demons algorithm is used to co-register an atlas surface onto a subject surface. A lobar based atlas of the cerebral cortex was created from a manual parcellation of the cortex. The atlas surface was then co-registered to five additional subjects using a spherical diffeomorphic demons algorithm. The labels from the atlas surface were warped on the subject surface and compared to the manual raters. The average Dice overlap index was 0.89 across all regions.</p>

	Localized difference in the cortex is one of the most useful morphometric traits in human and animal brain studies. There are many tools and methods already developed to automatically measure and analyze cortical thickness for the human brain. However, these tools cannot be directly applied to rodent brains due to the different scales; even adult rodent brains are 50 to 100 times smaller than humans. This paper describes an algorithm for automatically measuring the cortical thickness of mouse and rat brains. The algorithm consists of three steps: segmentation, thickness measurement, and statistical analysis among experimental groups. The segmentation step provides the neocortex separation from other brain structures and thus is a preprocessing step for the thickness measurement. In the thickness measurement step, the thickness is computed by solving a Laplacian PDE and a transport equation. The Laplacian PDE first creates streamlines as an analogy of cortical columns; the transport equation computes the length of the streamlines. The result is stored as a thickness map over the neocortex surface. For the statistical analysis, it is important to sample thickness at corresponding points. This is achieved by the particle correspondence algorithm which minimizes entropy between dynamically moving sample points called particles. Since the computational cost of the correspondence algorithm may limit the number of corresponding points, we use thin-plate spline based interpolation to increase the number of corresponding sample points. As a driving application, we measured the thickness difference to assess the effects of adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure that persist into adulthood and performed t-test between the control and exposed rat groups. We found significantly differing regions in both hemispheres.</p>

	The analysis of neuroimaging data from pediatric populations presents several challenges. There are normal variations in brain shape from infancy to adulthood and normal developmental changes related to tissue maturation. Measurement of cortical thickness is one important way to analyze such developmental tissue changes. We developed a novel framework that allows group-wise automatic mesh-based analysis of cortical thickness. Our approach is divided into four main parts. First an individual pre-processing pipeline is applied on each subject to create genus-zero inflated white matter cortical surfaces with cortical thickness measurements. The second part performs an entropy-based group-wise shape correspondence on these meshes using a particle system, which establishes a trade-off between an even sampling of the cortical surfaces and the similarity of corresponding points across the population using sulcal depth information and spatial proximity. A novel automatic initial particle sampling is performed using a matched 98-lobe parcellation map prior to a particle-splitting phase. Third, corresponding re-sampled surfaces are computed with interpolated cortical thickness measurements, which are finally analyzed via a statistical vertex-wise analysis module. This framework consists of a pipeline of automated 3D Slicer compatible modules. It has been tested on a small pediatric dataset and incorporated in an open-source C++ based high-level module called GAMBIT. GAMBIT\&$\#$39;s setup allows efficient batch processing, grid computing and quality control. The current research focuses on the use of an average template for correspondence and surface re-sampling, as well as thorough validation of the framework and its application to clinical pediatric studies.</p>

In contrast to previous techniques that compute a global warping based on feature masks of textures, our approach allows to transform one texture into another by considering both intensity values and structural features of textures simultaneously. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach for different textures, such as stochastic, semi-structural and regular textures, with different levels of complexities. Our method produces visually appealing transformation sequences with no user interaction.</p>

	Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc) is an uncommon autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations of the VPS13A gene, which encodes for the membrane protein chorein. ChAc presents with progressive limb and orobuccal chorea, but there is often a marked dysexecutive syndrome. ChAc may first present with neuropsychiatric disturbance such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suggesting a particular role for disruption to striatal structures involved in non-motor frontostriatal loops, such as the head of the caudate nucleus. Two previous studies have suggested a marked reduction in volume in the caudate nucleus and putamen, but did not examine morphometric change. We investigated morphometric change in 13 patients with genetically or biochemically confirmed ChAc and 26 age- and gender-matched controls. Subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging and manual segmentation of the caudate nucleus and putamen, and shape analysis using a non-parametric spherical harmonic technique. Both structures showed significant and marked reductions in volume compared with controls, with reduction greatest in the caudate nucleus. Both structures showed significant shape differences, particularly in the head of the caudate nucleus. No significant correlation was shown between duration of illness and striatal volume or shape, suggesting that much structural change may have already taken place at the time of symptom onset. Our results suggest that striatal neuron loss may occur early in the disease process, and follows a dorsal-ventral gradient that may correlate with early neuropsychiatric and cognitive presentations of the disease.</p>

<p>Regularization is used in deformable image registration to encourage plausible displacement fields, and significantly impacts the derived correspondences. Sliding motion, such as that between the lungs and chest wall and between the abdominal organs, complicates regis- tration because many regularizations are global smoothness constraints that produce errors at object boundaries. We present locally adaptive regularizations that handle sliding objects with locally planar and tubu- lar geometries. These regularizations allow discontinuities to develop in the displacement field at sliding interfaces and increase the independence with which regions surrounding distinct geometric structures can behave. Validation is performed by registering inhale and exhale abdominal com- puted tomography (CT) images and artificial images of a sliding tube. The sliding registration methods produce more realistic correspondences that may better reflect the underlying physical motion, while performing as well as the diffusive regularization with respect to image match.</p>

	year = {2010},
	abstract = {<p>Guided Lamb waves are commonly used in nondestructive evaluation to monitor plate-like structures or to characterize properties of composite or layered materials. However, the dispersive propagation and multimode excitability of Lamb waves complicate their analysis. Advanced signal processing techniques are therefore required to resolve both the time and frequency content of the time-domain wave signals. The chirplet transform (CT) has been introduced as a generalized time-frequency representation (TFR) incorporating more flexibility to adjust the window function to the group delay of the signal when compared to the more classical short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Exploiting this additional degree of freedom, this paper applies an adaptive algorithm based on the CT to calculate mode displacement ratios and attenuation of Lamb waves in elastic plate structures. The CT-based algorithm has a clear performance advantage when calculating mode displacement ratios and attenuation for numerically-simulated Lamb wave signals. For experimental data, the CT retains an advantage over the STFT although measurement noise and parameter uncertainties lead to larger overall deviations from the theoretically expected solutions.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Automatic image analysis of magnetic resonance (MR) images of the knee is simplified by bringing the knee into a reference position. While the knee is typically put into a reference position during image acquisition, this alignment will generally not be perfect. To correct for imperfections, we propose a two-step process of bone segmentation followed by elastic tissue deformation. The approach makes use of a fully-automatic segmentation of femur and tibia from T1 and T2* images. The segmentation algorithm is based on a continuous convex optimization problem, incorporating regional, and shape information. The regional terms are included from a probabilistic viewpoint, which readily allows the inclusion of shape information. Segmentation of the outer boundary of the cortical bone is encouraged by adding simple appearance-based information to the optimization problem. The resulting segmentation without the shape alignment step is globally optimal.</p>

<p>Standard registration is problematic for knee alignment due to the distinct physical properties of the tissues constituting the knee (bone, muscle, etc.). We therefore develop an alternative alignment approach based on a simple elastic deformation model combined with strict enforcement of similarity transforms for femur and tibia based on the obtained segmentations.</p>

	abstract = {<p>Respiratory motion challenges lung radiation therapy with uncertainties of the location of important anatomical structures in the thorax. To capture the trajectory of the motion, dense image matching methods and learning-based motion prediction methods have been commonly used. However, both methods have limitations. Serious motion artifacts in treatment-guidance images, such as streak artifacts in respiration-correlated cone-beam CT, challenge the intensity-based image matching; the learning-based prediction methods require consistency between the training data for planning and the data for treatment. This paper proposes a prediction-driven motion atlas framework for motion estimation with artifact-laden images, using a Frechet-mean-image matching scheme that is softly constrained by deformation predictions. In this framework, all the respiration phase-stamped images within a breathing cycle are dieomorphically deformed to their Frechet mean. The iterative optimization is driven by both intensity matching forces and the prediction forces trained from patient-specic planning images. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated with computational phantom and real cone-beam CT images.</p>

	Frontostriatal circuit mediated cognitive dysfunction has been implicated in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and may differ across subtypes of FTLD. We manually segmented the neostriatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) in FTLD subtypes: behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, FTD, n=12; semantic dementia, SD, n=13; and progressive nonfluent aphasia, PNFA, n=9); in comparison with controls (n=27). Diagnoses were based on international consensus criteria. Manual bilateral segmentation of the caudate nucleus and putamen was conducted blind to diagnosis by a single analyst, on MRI scans using a standardized protocol. Intra-cranial volume was calculated via a stereological point counting technique and was used for normalizing the shape analysis. Segmented binaries were analyzed using the SPHARM Shape Analysis tools (University of North Carolina) to perform comparisons between FTLD subtypes and controls for global shape difference, local significance maps and mean magnitude maps of shape displacement. Shape analysis revealed that there was significant shape difference between FTLD subtypes and controls, consistent with the predicted frontostriatal dysfunction and of significant magnitude, as measured by displacement maps. These differences were not significant for SD compared to controls; lesser for PNFA compared to controls; whilst FTD showed a more specific pattern in regions relaying fronto- and cortico-striatal circuits. Shape analysis shows regional specificity of atrophy, manifest as shape deflation, with a differential between FTLD subtypes, compared to controls.<br />

	The purpose of this study was to study the effect of calcium, cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP) on embryonic stem cell (ESC) motility during TNF-alpha-induced chemotaxis. ESCs were monitored using a chemotaxis chamber, with different concentrations of calcium or cAMP or cGMP added to the medium. Changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) were measured with the fluorescent dye fura-2/AM. We combined migratory parameters in a mathematical model and described it as \&quot;mobility\&quot;. After adding calcium, a dose-dependant increase in cell speed was found. Cyclic AMP increased mobility as well as the [Ca(2+)](i). In contrast, adding dbcGMP resulted in a significant decrease in the mobility of the ESCs. During migration ESCs showed an increase in [Ca(2+)](i). Furthermore, TNF-alpha dramatically increased the movement as well as the directionality of ESCs. These results demonstrate that ESCs are highly motile and respond to different concentrations of calcium in a dose-related manner.</p>

These spectral measures are isometry invariant and therefore allow for shape comparisons with minimal shape pre-processing. In particular, no registration, mapping, or remeshing is necessary. The discriminatory power of the 2D surface and 3D solid methods is demonstrated on a population of female caudate nuclei (a subcortical gray matter structure of the brain, involved in memory function, emotion processing, and learning) of normal control subjects and of subjects with schizotypal personality disorder. The behavior and properties of the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues and -functions are discussed extensively for both the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition showing advantages of the Neumann vs. the Dirichlet spectra in 3D. Furthermore, topological analyses employing the Morse-Smale complex (on the surfaces) and the Reeb graph (in the solids) are performed on selected eigenfunctions, yielding shape descriptors, that are capable of localizing geometric properties and detecting shape differences by indirectly registering topological features such as critical points, level sets and integral lines of the gradient field across subjects. The use of these topological features of the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions in 2D and 3D for statistical shape analysis is novel.</p>

	We describe a new method to automatically discriminate between patients with Alzheimer\&$\#$39;s disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly controls, based on multidimensional classification of hippocampal shape features. This approach uses spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients to model the shape of the hippocampi, which are segmented from magnetic resonance images (MRI) using a fully automatic method that we previously developed. SPHARM coefficients are used as features in a classification procedure based on support vector machines (SVM). The most relevant features for classification are selected using a bagging strategy. We evaluate the accuracy of our method in a group of 23 patients with AD (10 males, 13 females, age+/-standard-deviation (SD)=73+/-6 years, mini-mental score (MMS)=24.4+/-2.8), 23 patients with amnestic MCI (10 males, 13 females, age+/-SD=74+/-8 years, MMS=27.3+/-1.4) and 25 elderly healthy controls (13 males, 12 females, age+/-SD=64+/-8 years), using leave-one-out cross-validation. For AD vs controls, we obtain a correct classification rate of 94\%, a sensitivity of 96\%, and a specificity of 92\%. For MCI vs controls, we obtain a classification rate of 83\%, a sensitivity of 83\%, and a specificity of 84\%. This accuracy is superior to that of hippocampal volumetry and is comparable to recently published SVM-based whole-brain classification methods, which relied on a different strategy. This new method may become a useful tool to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer\&$\#$39;s disease.</p>

DTI is a relatively new imaging technique, and new tools developed for quantifying fibre tracts require evaluation. The purpose of this study was to compare the reliability of a novel clustering approach with a multiple region of interest (MROI) approach in both healthy and disease (schizophrenia) populations. DTI images were acquired in 20 participants (n=10 patients with schizophrenia: 56+/-15 years; n=10 controls: 51+/-20 years) (1.5 T GE system) with diffusion gradients applied in 23 non-collinear directions, repeated three times. Whole brain seeding and creation of fibre tracts were then performed. Interrater reliability of the clustering approach, and the MROI approach, were each evaluated and the methods compared. There was high spatial (voxel-based) agreement within and between the clustering and MROI methods. Fractional anisotropy, trace, and radial and axial diffusivity values showed high intraclass correlation (p<0.001 for all tracts) for each approach. Differences in scalar indices of diffusion between the clustering and MROI approach were minimal. The excellent interrater reliability of the clustering method and high agreement with the MROI method, quantitatively and spatially, indicates that the clustering method can be used with confidence. The clustering method avoids biases of ROI drawing and placement, and, not limited by a priori predictions, may be a more robust and efficient way to identify and measure white matter tracts of interest.},

	BACKGROUND: Previously, we reported abnormal volume and global shape in the caudate nucleus in schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). Here, we use a new shape measure which importantly permits local in addition to global shape analysis, as well as local correlations with behavioral measures. METHODS: Thirty-two female and 15 male SPDs, and 29 female and 14 male normal controls (NCLs), underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We assessed caudate shape measures using spherical harmonic-point distribution model (SPHARM-PDM) methodology. RESULTS: We found more pronounced global shape differences in the right caudate in male and female SPD, compared with NCLs. Local shape differences, principally in the caudate head, survived statistical correction on the right. Also, we performed correlations between local surface deformations with clinical measures and found significant correlations between local shape deflated deformations in the anterior medial surface of the caudate with verbal learning capacity in female SPD. CONCLUSIONS: Using SPHARM-PDM methodology, we found both global and local caudate shape abnormalities in male and female SPD, particularly right-sided, and largely restricted to limbic and cognitive anterior caudate. The most important and novel findings were bilateral statistically significant correlations between local surface deflations in the anterior medial surface of the head of the caudate and verbal learning capacity in female SPD. By extension, these local caudate correlation findings implicate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which innervates that area of the caudate, and demonstrate the utility of local shape analysis to investigate the relationship between specific subcortical and cortical brain structures in neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>

The observer is continuous-discrete, with continuous-time system dynamics and discrete-time measurements. Its state-space consists of an estimated curve position augmented by additional states (e.g., velocities) associated with every point on the estimated curve. Multiple simulation models are proposed for state prediction. Measurements are performed through standard static segmentation algorithms and optical-flow computations. Special emphasis is given to the geometric formulation of the overall dynamical system. The discrete-time measurements lead to the problem of geometric curve interpolation and the discrete-time filtering of quantities propagated along with the estimated curve. Interpolation and filtering are intimately linked to the correspondence problem between curves. Correspondences are established by a Laplace-equation approach. The proposed scheme is implemented completely implicitly (by Eulerian numerical solutions of transport equations) and thus naturally allows for topological changes and subpixel accuracy on the computational grid.</p>

	abstract = {<p>This work provides a framework for modeling and extracting the Cingulum Bundle (CB) from Diffusion-Weighted Imagery (DW-MRI) of the brain. The CB is a tube-like structure in the brain that is of potentially of tremendous importance to clinicians since it may be helpful in diagnosing Schizophrenia. This structure consists of a collection of fibers in the brain that have locally similar diffusion patterns, but vary globally. Standard region-based segmentation techniques adapted to DW-MRI are not suitable here because the diffusion pattern of the CB cannot be described by a global set of simple statistics. Active surface models extended to DW-MRI are not suitable since they allow for arbitrary deformations that give rise to unlikely shapes, which do not respect the tubular geometry of the CB. In this work, we explicitly model the CB as a tube-like surface and construct a general class of energies defined on tube-like surfaces. An example energy of our framework is optimized by a tube that encloses a region that has locally similar diffusion patterns, which differ from the diffusion patterns immediately outside. Modeling the CB as a tube-like surface is a natural shape prior. Since a tube is characterized by a center-line and a radius function, the method is reduced to a 4D (center-line plus radius) curve evolution that is computationally much less costly than an arbitrary surface evolution. The method also provides the center-line of CB, which is potentially of clinical significance.</p>

A (d-dimensional) unitary cube (for a d-dimensional digital image) is associated with every discrete picture element, instead of a point in epsilon(d) (the d-dimensional Euclidean space) as has been done previously. A simple point in this setting then refers to the removal of a unitary cube without changing the topology of the cubical complex induced by the digital image.

	In this paper we propose a formal formulation for the estimation of Diffusion Tensors in the space of symmetric positive semidefinite (PSD) tensors. Traditionally, diffusion tensor model estimation has been carried out imposing tensor symmetry without constraints for negative eigenvalues. When diffusion weighted data does not follow the diffusion model, due to noise or signal drop, negative eigenvalues may arise. An estimation method that accounts for the positive definiteness is desirable to respect the underlying principle of diffusion. This paper proposes such an estimation method and provides a theoretical interpretation of the result. A closed-form solution is derived that is the optimal data-fit in the matrix 2-norm sense, removing the need for optimization-based tensor estimation.</p>

	Visual tracking using active contours is usually set in a static framework. The active contour tracks the object of interest in a given frame of an image sequence. A subsequent prediction step ensures good initial placement for the next frame. This approach is unnatural; the curve evolution gets decoupled from the actual dynamics of the objects to be tracked. True dynamical approaches exist, all being marker particle based and thus prone to the shortcomings of such particle-based implementations. In particular, topological changes are not handled naturally in this framework. The now classical level set approach is tailored for evolutions of manifolds of codimension one. However, dynamic curve evolution is at least a codimension two problem. We propose an efficient, level set based approach for dynamic curve evolution, which addresses the artificial separation of segmentation and prediction while retaining all the desirable properties of the level set formulation. It is based on a new energy minimization functional which, for the first time, puts dynamics into the geodesic active contour framework.</p>

	Individual white matter fibers cannot be resolved by current magnetic resonance (MR) technology. Many fibers of a fiber bundle will pass through an individual volume element (voxel). Individual visualized fiber tracts are thus the result of interpolation on a relatively coarse voxel grid, and an infinite number of them may be generated in a given volume by interpolation. This paper aims at creating a level set representation of a fiber bundle to describe this apparent continuum of fibers. It further introduces a coordinate system warped to the fiber bundle geometry, allowing for the definition of geometrically meaningful fiber bundle measures.</p>

	In this paper we propose a principled approach for shape comparison. Given two surfaces, one to one correspondences are determined using the Laplace equation. The distance between corresponding points is then used to define both global and local dissimilarity statistics between the surfaces. This technique provides a powerful method to compare shapes both locally and globally for the purpose of segmentation, registration or shape analysis. For improved accuracy, we propose a Boundary Element Method. Our approach is applicable to datasets of any dimension and offers subpixel resolution. We illustrate the usefulness of the technique for validation of segmentation, by defining global dissimilarity statistics and visualizing errors locally on color-coded surfaces. We also show how our technique can be applied to multiple shapes comparison.</p>

	Time-frequency representations, like the spectrogram or the scalogram, are widely used to characterize dispersive waves. The resulting energy distributions, however, suffer from the uncertainty principle, which complicates the allocation of energy to individual propagation modes (especially when the dispersion curves of these modes are close to each other in the time-frequency domain). This research applies the chirplet as a tool to analyze dispersive wave signals based on a dispersion model. The chirplet transform, a generalization of both the wavelet and the short-time Fourier transform, enables the extraction of components of a signal with a particular instantaneous frequency and group delay. An adaptive algorithm identifies frequency regions for which quantitative statements can be made about an individual mode\&$\#$39;s energy, and employs chirplets (locally adapted to a dispersion curve model) to extract the (proportional) energy distribution of that single mode from a multimode dispersive wave signal. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated on a multimode synthetic Lamb wave signal for which the ground-truth energy distribution is known for each mode. Finally, the robustness of this algorithm is demonstrated on real, experimentally measured Lamb wave signals by an adaption of a correlation technique developed in previous research.</p>

Our results show that the SWC representation indicates new areas of significance preserved under the FDR correction for both the left caudate nucleus and left hippocampus.

	This paper proposes a deterministic observer framework for visual tracking based on non-parametric implicit (level-set) curve descriptions. The observer is continuousdiscrete, with continuous-time system dynamics and discretetime measurements. Its state-space consists of an estimated curve position augmented by additional states (e.g., velocities) associated with every point on the estimated curve. Multiple simulation models are proposed for state prediction. Measurements are performed through standard static segmentation algorithms and optical-flow computations. Special emphasis is given to the geometric formulation of the overall dynamical system. The discrete-time measurements lead to the problem of geometric curve interpolation and the discrete-time filtering of quantities propagated along with the estimated curve. Interpolation and filtering are intimately linked to the correspondence problem between curves. Correspondences are established by a Laplace-equation approach. The proposed scheme is implemented completely implicitly (by Eulerian numerical solutions of transport equations) and thus naturally allows for topological changes and subpixel accuracy on the computational grid.</p>

For real-time tracking, fast convergence of the active contour as wen as rapid computation of the optical flow are crucial. In this note, we will describe algorithms that make fast tracking possible in this framework using only standard computing platforms.</p>

	A new definition of affine invariant medial axis of planar closed curves is introduced. A point belongs to the affine medial axis if and only if it is equidistant from at least two points of the curve, with the distance being a minimum and given by the areas between the curve and its corresponding chords. The medial axis is robust, eliminating the need for curve denoising. In a dynamical interpretation of this affine medial axis, the medial axis points are the affine shock positions of the affine erosion of the curve. We propose a simple method to compute the medial axis and give examples. We also demonstrate how to use this method to detect affine skew symmetry in real images.</p>

	In this paper we describe two methods for tracking planar curves which are allowed to change topology. In contrast to previous approaches a level set formulation is used that allows for the propagation of state information (here a velocity vector) with every point on a curve. The curve dynamics are derived by minimizing an action integral (based on Hamilton\&$\#$39;s principle). Incorporating velocity information for every point on a curve lifts the originally two dimensional problem to four dimensions, and thus to a codimeusion three problem. Since basic level set approaches implicitly describe codimension one hypersurfaces, we introduce two methods suitable for codimension three problems within a level set framework. The partial level set approach, which propagates velocity information along with the curve by solving two additional transport equations, and the full level set approach, which is formulated by means of a vector distance function evolution equation. The full level set approach allow for complete topological flexibility (including intersecting curves in the image plane). However, it is computationally expensive. The partial level set approach compromises the topological flexibility for computational efficiency. In particular, the full level set ap proacb has the potential for tracking objects throughout occlusions, when combined with a suitable collision detection algorithm.</p>

	A time-frequency representation (TFR) is used to analyze the interaction of a multimode and dispersive Lamb wave with a notch, and then serves as the basis for a correlation technique to locate the notch. The experimental procedure uses a laser source and a dual-probe laser interferometer to generate and detect Lamb waves in a notched plate. The high fidelity, broad-bandwidth, point-like and noncontact nature of laser ultrasonics are critical to the success of this study, making it possible to experimentally measure transient Lamb waves without any frequency biases. A specific TFR, the reassigned spectrogram, is used to resolve the dispersion curves of the individual modes of the plate, and then the slowness-frequency representation (SFR) of the plate is calculated from this reassigned spectrogram. By considering the notch to be an additional (second) source, the reflected and transmitted contributions of each Lamb mode are automatically identified using the SFRs. These results are then used to develop a quantitative understanding of the interaction of an incident Lamb wave with a notch, helping to identify mode conversion. Finally, two complementary, automated localization techniques are developed based on this understanding of scattering of Lamb waves.</p>

	This paper examines the propagation of guided circumferential waves in a hollow isotropic cylinder that contains a crack, with the goal of using these guided waves to both locate and size the crack. The crack is sized using a modified Auld\&acirc;\&euro;\&trade;s formula, which relates the crack\&acirc;\&euro;\&trade;s length to a reflected energy coefficient. The crack is then located by operating on the backscattered signal with a time-frequency digital signal processing (DSP) technique, and then comparing these results to those obtained if the cylinder is perfect. The guided circumferential waves are generated with a commercial finite element method (FEM) code. One objective of this work is to demonstrate the effectiveness of using sophisticated DSP techniques to describe the effect of scattering on dispersive waves, showing it is possible to characterize cracks systematically and accurately by quantifying this scattering effect. The results show that the need for high frequency signals to detect small cracks is significantly decreased by using these techniques.</p>

	In this note we investigate parameter identification for nonlinear continuous-time SISO systems, based on input/output data, where the output is assumed to be noise corrupted. Continuous-time identification requires (i) the estimation of derivatives of the output (which is nontrivial due to the influence of noise), a suitable measure thereof or a way to avoid them and (ii) methods for parameter estimation based on the measured data. Problem (i) is addressed by reviewing modulating functions and the concept of delayed state variable filters; furthermore a high-gain observer is introduced as an approach to provide the necessary derivative information. Its performance is investigated with respect to the modulating function and the delayed state variable filter approaches. Least-squares methods are assessed for continuous-time nonlinear identification (problem (ii)). It is shown that parameter identification based in modulating functions and a standard least-squares method does not guarantee bias-free estimates for some systems. Whereas ordinary (or weighted) least-squares is sufficient for parameter identification by means of modulating functions it is not for the delayed state variable filter and the high-gain observer approaches (due to dependencies between error terms). Requirements on least-squares methods for nonlinear continuous-time system identification are discusses and a solution for bilinear systems is given. The importance of an appropriate least-squares method is underlined by parameter identification for a simulated bilinear example system.</p>

The proposed procedure first uses the spectrogram to operate on a single, laser-generated and detected waveform to develop the dispersion relationship for this plate. Next, a reassignment procedure is used to refine the time-frequency resolution of the calculated dispersion curves. This reassignment operation clarifies the definition of the measured modes. This study demonstrates that the reassigned spectrogram is capable of distinguishing multiple, closely spaced Lamb modes in the ultrasonic frequency range.</p>

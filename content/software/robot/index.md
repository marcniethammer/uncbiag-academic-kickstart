This software provides a general framework for point cloud/mesh registration based on robust optimal mass transport (robOT) / unbalanced optimal mass transport. It supports both optimization- and learning-based registration approaches. It also provides a general framework for deep prediction tasks, e.g. for 3D landmark detection. Further, we provide the PVT1010 dataset which contains 1010 lung vessel tree pairs.

EasyReg is an extension that builds on Mermaid, providing a simple interface to Mermaid and other popluar registration packages.

The currently supported methods include Mermaid-optimization (i.e., optimization-based registration) and Mermaid-network (i.e., deep network-based registration methods using the mermaid deformation models, like SVF, LDDMM, RDMM...).
We also added some supports on [ANTsPy](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsPy), [NiftyReg](http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftyReg) and Demons(embedded in [SimpleITK](http://www.simpleitk.org/SimpleITK/resources/software.html)).

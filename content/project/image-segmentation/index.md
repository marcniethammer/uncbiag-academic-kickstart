We have worked on a number of different general methods for image segmentation {{<cite "znf09">}} {{<cite "dny09">}} with a recent focus on segmentation methods based on convex relaxations which incorporate domain knowledge (for example in the form of encouraging directed orientation transitions {{<cite "zsf09">}} {{<cite "szn10">}} {{<cite "ssz10">}}. We have also devised segmentation methods for the segmentations of fiber bundles from diffusion weighted images {{<cite "nzm09">}} as well as a method to extract connectivity information from diffusion tensor images {{<cite "nbz10">}} and have most recently explored a segmentation method which can impose constraints on the segmentation area {{<cite "nz13">}}.

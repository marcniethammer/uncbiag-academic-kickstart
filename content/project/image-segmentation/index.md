We have worked on a number of different general methods for image segmentation <a href="#znf09">[znf09]</a> <a href="#dny09">[dny09]</a> with a recent focus on segmentation methods based on convex relaxations which incorporate domain knowledge (for example in the form of encouraging directed orientation transitions <a href="#zsf09">[zsf09]</a> <a href="#szn10">[szn10]</a> <a href="#szs10">[szs10]</a>. We have also devised segmentation methods for the segmentations of fiber bundles from diffusion weighted images <a href="#nzm09">[nzm09]</a> as well as a method to extract connectivity information from diffusion tensor images <a href="#nbz10">[nbz10]</a> and have most recently explored a segmentation method which can impose constraints on the segmentation area <a href="#nz13">[nz13]</a>.

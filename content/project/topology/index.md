We have developed various analysis approaches based on topology. Our early work explored using topological descriptors for shape analysis ({{<cite "mischaikow02">}}{{<cite "niethammer06">}}). We have also explored using topology to characterize cell arrangements in the context of breast cancer ({{<cite "singh14">}}) and as general shape descriptors ({{<cite "hofer17b">}}). Another focus has been how to combine persistence diagrams with machine learning, in a kernel setting ({{<cite "kwitt15">}}) as well as using deep learning ({{<cite "hofer17a">}}{{<cite "hofer19b">}}). As persistence diagrams require the definition of a filtration we have explored learning the corresponding filter function as well ({{<cite "hofer20b">}}). Most recently we have explored how to use topology to obtain distributions which are beneficial for small-sample learning ({{<cite "hofer20a">}}).

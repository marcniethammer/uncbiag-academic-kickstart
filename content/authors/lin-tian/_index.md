I am a second year graduate student in computer science at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under supervision of [Marc Niethammer]({{<ref "/individual_user_pages/marc-niethammer/index.md">}}).  I am interested in deformable image registration models and exploring the sweet point where image registration meets machine learning. Currently, I am working on lung registration.

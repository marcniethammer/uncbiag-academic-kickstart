Congratulations to {{% mention "zhenlin-xu" %}} who got his ICLR paper on robust and generalizable visual representation learning accepted {{<cite "zx20">}}. Congratulations also to Chris and Florian who got their works on graph filtration learning {{<cite "ch20a">}}, topologically densified distributions {{<cite "chb20">}}, and an analysis of the supervised contrastive loss {{<cite "fg21">}} accepted at ICML20/21. Lastly, we also published a paper at NeurIPS 2020, which uses an initial value perspective to parameterize deep neural networks {{<cite "fx20">}}.

Congratulations to {{% mention "zhipeng-ding" %}}, {{% mention "hastings-greer" %}}, and {{% mention "peirong-liu" %}}  who got their ICCV and CVPR papers accepted. These papers explore local probability calibration for semantic segmentation {{<cite "zd21">}}, non-parametric image registration by inverse consistency {{<cite "hg21">}} which allows eliminating almost all registration hyperparameters, and perfusion imaging via deep learning {{<cite "pl21">}}.

Congratulations to {{% mention "zhipeng-ding" %}} and {{% mention "hastings-greer" %}} who got their ICCV papers accepted. These papers explore local probability calibration for semantic segmentation {{<cite "zd21">}} and non-parametric image registration by inverse consistency {{<cite "hg21">}} which allows eliminating almost all registration hyperparameters.

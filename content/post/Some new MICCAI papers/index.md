Congratulations to  {{% mention "boqi-chen" %}}, {{% mention "hastings-greer" %}}, {{% mention "lin-tian" %}} and {{% mention "nurislam-tursynbek" %}} who got their MICCAI papers accepted. These papers explore image synthesis via retrieval {{<cite "bc23">}}, image registration via deep learning where inverse consistency is assured even when using multiple registration steps {{<cite "hg23">}}, and unsupervised image segmentation using diffusion models {{<cite "nt23">}}.

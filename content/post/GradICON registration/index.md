Congratulations to {{% mention "lin-tian" %}}, {{% mention "hastings-greer" %}} who are presenting their CVPR paper on gradient inverse consistent image registraton (GradICON) this week. GradICON is a new deep-learning-based image registration approach which only weakly regularizes the tranformations via a new gradient inverse consistency loss. Doing so results in state-of-the-art registration performance (as tested on 3D knee, lung, and brain images) without the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

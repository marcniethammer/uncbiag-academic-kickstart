abstract: "Individual white matter fibers cannot be resolved by current magnetic resonance (MR) technology. Many fibers of a fiber bundle will pass through an individual volume element (voxel). Individual visualized fiber tracts are thus the result of interpolation on a relatively coarse voxel grid, and an infinite number of them may be generated in a given volume by interpolation. This paper aims at creating a level set representation of a fiber bundle to describe this apparent continuum of fibers. It further introduces a coordinate system warped to the fiber bundle geometry, allowing for the definition of geometrically meaningful fiber bundle measures."

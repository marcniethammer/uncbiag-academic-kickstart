 abstract = {We segment and topologically classify brain vessel data obtained from magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The segmentation is done adaptively and the classification by means of cubical homology, i.e. the computation of homology groups. In this way the number of connected components; (measured by H/sub 0/), the tunnels (given by H/sub 1/) and the voids (given by H/sub 2/) are determined, resulting in a topological characterization of the blood vessels.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel directional level set segmentation framework employing the theory of Finsler active contours. The framework provides a natural way to perform segmentation of image data in oriented domains. We share examples of this technique on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imagery (DW-MRI) for the segmentation of neural fiber bundles and we show examples of texture based segmentation using structure tensors. We also demonstrate that for some applications higher accuracy is achieved by the proposed framework than by level set methods that employ Riemannian metrics. This gain is attributed to the relaxation of the tensor model constraint which is imposed upon the metric in the Riemannian case.},

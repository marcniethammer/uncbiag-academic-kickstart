 abstract = {Visual tracking using active contours is usually set in a static framework. The active contour tracks the object of interest in a given frame of an image sequence. A subsequent prediction step ensures good initial placement for the next frame. This approach is unnatural; the curve evolution gets decoupled from the actual dynamics of the objects to be tracked. True dynamical approaches exist, all being marker particle based and thus prone to the shortcomings of such particle-based implementations. In particular, topological changes are not handled naturally in this framework. The now classical level set approach is tailored for evolutions of manifolds of codimension one. However, dynamic curve evolution is at least a codimension two problem. We propose an efficient, level set based approach for dynamic curve evolution, which addresses the artificial separation of segmentation and prediction while retaining all the desirable properties of the level set formulation. It is based on a new energy minimization functional which, for the first time, puts dynamics into the geodesic active contour framework.},

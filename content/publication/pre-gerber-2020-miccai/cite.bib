 abstract = {Voxel-based analysis provides a simple, easy to interpret approach to discover
regions correlated with a variable of interest such as for example a pathology
indicator. Voxel-based analysis methods perform a statistical test at each
voxel and are prone to false positives due to multiple testing, or when
corrected for multiple testing may miss regions of interest. Component based
approaches, such as principal or independent component analysis provide an
approach to mitigate multiple testing, by testing for correlations to projections
of the data to the components. We propose a spatially regularized component
analysis approach to find components for image data sets that are spatially
localized and smooth. We show that the proposed approach leads to components
that are easier to interpret and can improve predictive performance
when used with linear regression models. We develop an efficient optimization
approach using the Grassmannian projection kernel and a randomized SVD. The
proposed optimization is capable to deal with data sets to large too fit all at
once into memory. We demonstrate the approach with an application to study
Alzheimer's disease using over 1200 images from the OASIS-3 data set.},

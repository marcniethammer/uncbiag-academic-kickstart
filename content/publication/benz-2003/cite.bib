 abstract = {A time-frequency representation (TFR) is used to analyze the interaction of a multimode and dispersive Lamb wave with a notch, and then serves as the basis for a correlation technique to locate the notch. The experimental procedure uses a laser source and a dual-probe laser interferometer to generate and detect Lamb waves in a notched plate. The high fidelity, broad-bandwidth, point-like and noncontact nature of laser ultrasonics are critical to the success of this study, making it possible to experimentally measure transient Lamb waves without any frequency biases. A specific TFR, the reassigned spectrogram, is used to resolve the dispersion curves of the individual modes of the plate, and then the slowness-frequency representation (SFR) of the plate is calculated from this reassigned spectrogram. By considering the notch to be an additional (second) source, the reflected and transmitted contributions of each Lamb mode are automatically identified using the SFRs. These results are then used to develop a quantitative understanding of the interaction of an incident Lamb wave with a notch, helping to identify mode conversion. Finally, two complementary, automated localization techniques are developed based on this understanding of scattering of Lamb waves.},

abstract: "The objective of this study is to establish the effectiveness of four different time-frequency representations (TFRs): the reassigned spectrogram, the reassigned scalogram, the smoothed Wigner-Ville distribution, and the Hilbert spectrum by comparing their ability to resolve the dispersion relationships for Lamb waves generated and detected with optical techniques. This paper illustrates the utility of using TFRs to quantitatively resolve changes in the frequency content of these nonstationary signals, as a function of time. While each technique has certain strengths and weaknesses, the reassigned spectrogram appears to be the best choice to characterize multimode Lamb waves."

abstract: "This paper proposes to use the volumetric Laplace spectrum as a global shape descriptor for medical shape analysis. The approach allows for shape comparisons using minimal shape preprocessing. In particular, no registration, mapping, or remeshing is necessary. All computations can be performed directly on the voxel representations of the shapes. The discriminatory power of the method is tested on a population of female caudate shapes (brain structure) of normal control subjects and of subjects with schizotypal personality disorder. The behavior and properties of the volumetric Laplace spectrum are discussed extensively for both the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition showing advantages of the Neumann spectra. Both, the computations of spectra on 3D voxel data for shape matching as well as the use of the Neumann spectrum for shape analysis are completely new."

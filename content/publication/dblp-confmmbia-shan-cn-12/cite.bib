 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a multi-atlas-based method to automatically segment the femoral and tibial cartilage from T1 weighted magnetic resonance (MR) knee images. The segmentation result is a joint decision of the spatial priors from a multi-atlas registration and the local likelihoods within a Bayesian framework. The cartilage likelihoods are obtained from a probabilistic k nearest neighbor classification. Validation results on 18 knee MR images against the manual expert segmentations from a dataset acquired for osteoarthritis research show good performance for the segmentation of femoral and tibial cartilage (mean Dice similarity coefficient of 75.2% and 81.7% respectively).},

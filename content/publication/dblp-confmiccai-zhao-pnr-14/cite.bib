 abstract = {Fusion between an endoscopic movie and a CT can aid specifying the tumor target volume for radiotherapy. That requires a deformable pharyngeal surface registration between a 3D endoscope reconstruction and a CT segmentation. In this paper, we propose to use local geometric features for deriving a set of initial correspondences between two surfaces, with which an association graph can be constructed for registration by spectral graph matching. We also define a new similarity measurement to provide a meaningful way for computing inter-surface affinities in the association graph. Our registration method can deal with large non-rigid anatomical deformation, as well as missing data and topology change. We tested the robustness of our method with synthetic deformations and showed registration results on real data.},

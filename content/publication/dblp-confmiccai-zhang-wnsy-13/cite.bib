 abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been demonstrated to be very useful for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A common approach to using MR images for AD detection is to spatially normalize the images by non-rigid image registration, and then perform statistical analysis on the resulting deformation fields. Due to the high nonlinearity of the deformation field, recent studies suggest to use initial momentum instead as it lies in a linear space and fully encodes the deformation field. In this paper we explore the use of initial momentum for image classification by focusing on the problem of AD detection. Experiments on the public ADNI dataset show that the initial momentum, together with a simple sparse coding technique—locality-constrained linear coding (LLC)—can achieve a classification accuracy that is comparable to or even better than the state of the art. We also show that the performance of LLC can be greatly improved by introducing proper weights to the codebook.},

 abstract = {Inconsistencies in the preparation of histology slides make it difficult to perform quantitative analysis on their results. In this paper we provide two mechanisms for overcoming many of the known inconsistencies in the staining process, thereby bringing slides that were processed or stored under very different conditions into a common, normalized space to enable improved quantitative analysis.},

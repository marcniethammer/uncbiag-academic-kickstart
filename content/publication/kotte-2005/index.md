abstract: "This research develops an algorithm which provides excellent localization of Lamb wave dispersion curves while eliminating spurious components. This result is achieved by combining a differential reassignment procedure with non-linear anisotropic diffusion. This study examines the reassignment and diffusion components individually, before developing a combined algorithm. This combined algorithm is then applied to experimentally measured Lamb waves to develop an image of the dispersion curves of a plate with excellent clarity and definition. These dispersion curves are then used to increase the accuracy of a previously developed procedure to locate a notch."

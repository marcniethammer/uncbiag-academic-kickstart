abstract: "In this paper we propose a new method for shape analysis based on the depth-ordering of shapes. We use this depth-ordering to non-parametrically define depth with respect to a normal control population. This allows us to quantify differences with respect to “normality”. We combine this approach with a permutation test allowing it to test for localized shape differences. The method is evaluated on a synthetically generated striatum dataset as well as on a real caudate dataset."
